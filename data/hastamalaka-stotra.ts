 *
 * Traditionally attributed to Hastamalakach, a young disciple of Adi Shankaracharya
 *
 * This remarkable hymn presents pure Advaita teaching through the words of
 * Hastamalaka, a young boy who appeared intellectually disabled but possessed
 * complete Self-knowledge. When Shankaracharya asked "Who are you?" the boy
 * spontaneously sang these verses describing the nature of the Self with

    sanskrit: "भो श्रोत्रियगुरुशिष्या नाहं जीवो न मे जीवभावः। चिद्रूपोऽहं सदा शिवरूपो भासो-हं भास्कराणां॥",
    transliteration: "bho śrotriyaguruśiṣyā nāhaṁ jīvo na me jīvabhāvaḥ | cidrūpo'haṁ sadā śivarūpo bhāso'haṁ bhāskarāṇām ||",
    translation: "O disciples of the learned Guru! I am not the individual soul (jiva), nor do I have the nature of the jiva. I am always of the nature of Pure Consciousness and Auspiciousness (Shiva). I am the light that illumines even the luminaries.",
    commentary: "The boy's opening statement is revolutionary—he immediately negates the empirical identity. When asked 'Who are you?' the normal response would be name, family, age, etc. Instead, Hastamalaka goes directly to the essential truth: 'I am not the jiva.' The jiva is the individual soul bound by karma, subject to birth and death, experiencing limitation. The verse distinguishes being (jiva) from the sense of being a jiva (jiva-bhava)—even the psychological identification is negated. What remains? Chit-rupa (the form of Pure Consciousness) and Shiva-rupa (the form of Auspiciousness/Brahman). The final line is profound: 'I am the light of luminaries.' The sun, moon, stars appear to be sources of light, but they shine because Consciousness illumines them. Without the light of awareness, even the sun would not be known to shine. Thus, Consciousness is the ultimate light, the subject that can never become an object."

    sanskrit: "न मे द्वेष रागौ न मे लोभमोहौ मदो नैव मे नैव मात्सर्यभावः। न धर्मो न चार्थो न कामो न मोक्षः चिद्रूपोऽहं सदा शिवरूपः॥",
    transliteration: "na me dveṣa rāgau na me lobhamohau mado naiva me naiva mātsaryabhāvaḥ | na dharmo na cārtho na kāmo na mokṣaḥ cidrūpo'haṁ sadā śivarūpaḥ ||",
    translation: "I have no aversion or attachment, no greed or delusion, no pride or envy. I am not bound by dharma, artha, kama, or even moksha. I am always of the nature of Pure Consciousness and Auspiciousness.",
    commentary: "This verse parallels Nirvana Shatkam's third verse but comes from a child who never studied philosophy. The six enemies of the mind—kama (desire), krodha (anger), lobha (greed), moha (delusion), mada (pride), matsarya (envy)—are systematically negated. These are the fundamental psychological afflictions that bind the jiva. But for one who knows 'I am not the jiva,' these have no reality. Even more remarkably, the four purusharthas (life goals) are transcended. The verse declares: I am not bound by dharma (duty/righteousness), artha (wealth/security), kama (pleasure/desire), or even moksha (liberation). Why not moksha? Because you cannot become what you already are. Liberation is not a future attainment but present recognition. The free need not be freed. This is the maturity of Advaita—not seeking liberation as a goal but recognizing oneself as already the limitless, ever-free Consciousness."

    sanskrit: "नाहं पुण्यं न पापं न सौख्यं न दुःखम् न मन्त्रो न तीर्थं न वेदो न यज्ञः। अहं भोजनं नैव भोज्यं न भोक्ता चिद्रूपोऽहं सदा शिवरूपः॥",
    transliteration: "nāhaṁ puṇyaṁ na pāpaṁ na saukhyaṁ na duḥkham na mantro na tīrthaṁ na vedo na yajñaḥ | ahaṁ bhojanaṁ naiva bhojyaṁ na bhoktā cidrūpo'haṁ sadā śivarūpaḥ ||",
    translation: "I am not virtue or sin, not pleasure or pain. I am not mantra, pilgrimage, Vedas, or ritual. I am not the act of eating, the food, or the eater. I am always of the nature of Pure Consciousness and Auspiciousness.",
    commentary: "Again echoing Nirvana Shatkam, this verse removes moral and ritual identifications. Merit (punya) and demerit (papa) are judgments made by the mind about actions; they don't touch the witness-Self. Pleasure (sukha) and pain (duhkha) are experiences that come and go; the Self is their unchanging background. Sacred practices—mantras, pilgrimages, Vedic study, fire rituals—are means for the unprepared mind, not the ultimate reality. The Self needs no purification because it's ever pure. The final statement dissolves the subject-object-action triad: in every experience, there's the doer (eater), the done-to (food), and the action (eating). But these three are appearances in the one Consciousness. In deep sleep, there's no eater, food, or eating, yet you exist. Similarly, the Self exists independent of all triadic experience. It's the non-dual reality in which the apparent three appear."

    sanskrit: "न मृत्युर्न शङ्का न मे जातिभेदः पिता नैव मे नैव माता न जन्म। न बन्धुर्न मित्रं गुरुर्नैव शिष्यः चिद्रूपोऽहं सदा शिवरूपः॥",
    transliteration: "na mṛtyurna śaṅkā na me jātibhedaḥ pitā naiva me naiva mātā na janma | na bandhurna mitraṁ gururnaiva śiṣyaḥ cidrūpo'haṁ sadā śivarūpaḥ ||",
    translation: "I have no death, no doubt, no distinction of caste or birth. I have no father, no mother, no relatives, no friends, no guru, no disciple. I am always of the nature of Pure Consciousness and Auspiciousness.",
    commentary: "This verse (also found in Nirvana Shatkam) takes on special poignancy coming from a child. Death (mrityu) and doubt (shanka) cannot touch the Self. Birth and caste are biological/social facts about the body-mind, not about Consciousness. Family relationships—father, mother, relatives, friends—exist at the conventional level but not at the level of the Self. Most daringly, even the guru-disciple relationship is negated. This doesn't diminish its importance at the relative level—indeed, Hastamalaka is responding to his guru! But at the absolute level, when there is only One without a second, who teaches whom? The guru is the Self teaching the Self about the Self. For one established in this knowledge, all relationships are seen as the play of the one Consciousness appearing as many. It's like one actor playing all roles in a drama—father, son, friend, enemy—while remaining the single actor."

    sanskrit: "अहं निर्विकल्पो निराकाररूपो विभुत्वाच्च सर्वत्र सर्वेन्द्रियाणाम्। न चासङ्गतं नैव मुक्तिर्न मेयः चिद्रूपोऽहं सदा शिवरूपः॥",
    transliteration: "ahaṁ nirvikalpo nirākārarūpo vibhutvācca sarvatra sarvendriyāṇām | na cāsaṅgataṁ naiva muktirna meyaḥ cidrūpo'haṁ sadā śivarūpaḥ ||",
    translation: "I am without mental modifications, without form, all-pervading, and beyond all senses. I am neither attached nor free, I am not an object of knowledge. I am always of the nature of Pure Consciousness and Auspiciousness.",
    commentary: "This profound verse (Nirvana Shatkam's final verse) reveals the positive nature of the Self. Nirvikalpa means free from thoughts, concepts, mental constructs—the Self is the thoughtless ground of consciousness. Nirakara means formless—every form is an object of perception; the Self is the formless perceiver. Vibhu means all-pervading—not located in space (which would make it limited) but the very ground in which space appears. Being beyond the senses means the Self can never be objectified—it's the eternal subject. The startling claim: 'neither attached nor free.' At the relative level, the ignorant are bound and the wise are liberated. But at the absolute level, the Self was never bound (bondage was only apparent), so liberation is not a real attainment. You cannot lose what you never had. Finally, 'not an object of knowledge' (na meya)—the Self cannot be known as an object because it IS the knower. The eye cannot see itself; the Self cannot objectify itself. It can only BE itself."

    sanskrit: "न चास्ति स्वर्गो न चास्ति नरकः न कश्चिद्वा अन्तरात्मा विहंगः। न सर्पा न सत्यं न कश्चिद् वियोगः चिद्रूपोऽहं सदा शिवरूपः॥",
    transliteration: "na cāsti svargo na cāsti narakaḥ na kaścidvā antarātmā vihaṅgaḥ | na sarpā na satyaṁ na kaścid viyogaḥ cidrūpo'haṁ sadā śivarūpaḥ ||",
    translation: "There is no heaven, no hell, no inner soul separate from the Supreme, no separation. There is no snake (delusion), no reality other than the Self, no separation whatsoever. I am always of the nature of Pure Consciousness and Auspiciousness.",
    commentary: "This verse demolishes dualistic cosmologies. Heaven (swarga) and hell (naraka) are mental constructs, rewards and punishments created by the dualistic mind. They have no absolute reality. The inner soul (antaratma) as something separate from the Supreme is negated—Jivatma and Paramatma are ultimately one. The 'snake' reference alludes to the classic rope-snake analogy: in the rope, there never was a snake; in Brahman, there never was a world. What we call 'reality' in the ordinary sense is mithya (dependent, apparent). The only absolute reality (satya/satyam) is Brahman—there is no second reality. The final word 'viyoga' (separation) is crucial: there is no separation between you and Brahman, between you and others, between subject and object. All apparent separation is ignorance. When ignorance is removed, the eternal non-dual reality stands revealed, always having been the case."

    sanskrit: "अहं साक्षी सर्वं जगदेकरूपं प्रकाशस्तु सर्वत्र सर्वस्य भासः। निर्गुणं निर्विशेषं निराकारमीडम् चिद्रूपोऽहं सदा शिवरूपः॥",
    transliteration: "ahaṁ sākṣī sarvaṁ jagadekarūpaṁ prakāśastu sarvatra sarvasya bhāsaḥ | nirguṇaṁ nirviśeṣaṁ nirākāramīḍam cidrūpo'haṁ sadā śivarūpaḥ ||",
    translation: "I am the witness of all, the entire universe is my one form. I am the light illuminating everything everywhere, the radiance of all that exists. I am without qualities, without distinctions, without form. I am always of the nature of Pure Consciousness and Auspiciousness.",
    commentary: "This verse presents the cosmic vision of Advaita. 'I am the witness (sakshi)'—the unchanging awareness that observes all changing phenomena. 'The universe is my one form'—not that the universe IS the Self, but that it appears in the Self like waves in the ocean. The entire multiplicity is one appearance in one Consciousness. 'I am the light'—Consciousness is self-luminous and illuminates everything else. Nothing can exist or be known without the light of Consciousness. 'Without qualities (nirguna)'—the Self has no attributes; all attributes belong to the body-mind or the world. 'Without distinctions (nirvisesha)'—in the Self there's no differentiation, no parts, no divisions. 'Without form (nirakara)'—all forms appear in the formless Consciousness. This is the paradox: the Self is simultaneously the witness of all (transcendent) and the substance of all (immanent), yet neither bound by nor limited to manifestation."

    sanskrit: "सच्चिद्रूपानन्दरूपं विजानामि सर्वगतमेकरूपम्। निरामयं निष्कलंकं विशुद्धं चिद्रूपोऽहं सदा शिवरूपः॥",
    transliteration: "saccid rūpānandarūpaṁ vijānāmi sarvagatamekarūpam | nirāmayaṁ niṣkalaṅkaṁ viśuddhaṁ cidrūpo'haṁ sadā śivarūpaḥ ||",
    translation: "I know myself as Existence-Consciousness-Bliss (Sat-Chit-Ananda), all-pervading and of one form, free from disease, spotless, and absolutely pure. I am always of the nature of Pure Consciousness and Auspiciousness.",
    commentary: "This verse gives the positive description of the Self using the classic Advaita formula: Sat-Chit-Ananda. Sat (Existence): the Self is the very ground of being, never ceasing to exist, unlike all objects which appear and disappear. Chit (Consciousness): the Self is aware, self-luminous, the very nature of knowing. Ananda (Bliss): not pleasure dependent on objects, but the peace of fullness, the joy of being free from all lack. These three are not qualities possessed by the Self but constitute its very nature—they are identical with the Self. 'All-pervading (sarvagata)'—limitless, beyond space. 'One form (eka-rupa)'—non-dual, without a second. 'Free from disease (niramaya)'—eternally healthy, untouched by the afflictions that affect the body-mind. 'Spotless (nishkalanka)'—unstained by any impurity, ever pure. This is what you truly are—not a concept to believe but a reality to recognize."

    sanskrit: "न सन्ध्या न देवो न मन्त्रो न तीर्थं न वेदो न यज्ञो न मातृपितॄणाम्। अभेदोऽस्मि तत्त्वे परे सर्वदैवं चिद्रूपोऽहं सदा शिवरूपः॥",
    transliteration: "na sandhyā na devo na mantro na tīrthaṁ na vedo na yajño na mātṛpitṝṇām | abhedo'smi tattve pare sarvadaivaṁ cidrūpo'haṁ sadā śivarūpaḥ ||",
    translation: "I need no twilight prayers, no gods, no mantras, no pilgrimages, no Vedas, no rituals, no parents. I am non-different from the supreme Reality, always and in all ways. I am always of the nature of Pure Consciousness and Auspiciousness.",
    commentary: "This verse may seem to reject spiritual practices, but it describes the state of the realized being who has transcended means and ends. Daily prayers (sandhya-vandana), worship of deities (deva), mantras, pilgrimages (tirtha), Vedic study, and rituals (yajna) are all valid means for purifying the mind and gaining knowledge. But once knowledge is firm, the means are no longer needed. It's like using a boat to cross a river—once across, you don't carry the boat. Even parents, who gave birth to this body, are recognized as not one's real source—the Self was never born, so has no parents. The key phrase is 'abheda asmi'—'I am non-different from the supreme Reality.' This is not identification with God as a separate being, but recognition that Atman (individual Self) and Brahman (universal Self) are one and the same, never actually separate. When this is firmly known (not just intellectually but experientially), all seeking ceases in the recognition of what always is."

    sanskrit: "न कर्ता न भोक्ता न चास्ति किञ्चित्करणीयमस्ति च मे विद्यमानम्। सदैव परमार्थतत्त्वरूपो चिद्रूपोऽहं सदा शिवरूपः॥",
    transliteration: "na kartā na bhoktā na cāsti kiñcitkaraṇīyamasti ca me vidyamānam | sadaiva paramārthatatva-rūpo cidrūpo'haṁ sadā śivarūpaḥ ||",
    translation: "I am not the doer, nor the experiencer. There is nothing to be done by me. I am always of the nature of the supreme absolute truth (Paramartha). I am always of the nature of Pure Consciousness and Auspiciousness.",
    commentary: "This verse addresses the illusion of doership and experiencership. We habitually think 'I am doing this' or 'This is happening to me.' But careful inquiry reveals: actions happen through this body-mind, but the witnessing Consciousness never acts. Just as a movie screen doesn't act though countless actions appear on it, Consciousness doesn't act though all actions appear in it. Similarly, experiences happen, but the Self doesn't experience in the sense of being affected or changed. It's the unchanging witness of all experiences. 'Nothing to be done' doesn't mean physical inaction but recognition that the Self needs no improvement, purification, or achievement—it's already perfect, complete. All doing belongs to prakriti (nature/matter); the Self is the actionless witness. 'Paramartha tattva' means the ultimate truth, as opposed to vyavaharika (conventional truth) or pratibhasika (apparent truth). The Self is the absolute reality, not a relative appearance."

    sanskrit: "अहं ब्रह्म नान्यत् किञ्चित्तत्त्वतो विद्यते जगदेतत्। मायामात्रं देहाद्यं सर्वकल्पितमेतत् चिद्रूपोऽहं सदा शिवरूपः॥",
    transliteration: "ahaṁ brahma nānyat kiñcittattavato vidyate jagadetat | māyāmātraṁ dehādyaṁ sarvakalpitametat cidrūpo'haṁ sadā śivarūpaḥ ||",
    translation: "I am Brahman, nothing else exists in reality. This entire universe is merely Maya. The body and everything else is entirely imagined. I am always of the nature of Pure Consciousness and Auspiciousness.",
    commentary: "This is the mahavakya (great statement) 'Aham Brahmasmi' (I am Brahman) spoken directly by a child. Not 'I will become Brahman' through practice, but 'I am Brahman' here and now. 'Nothing else exists in reality'—the universe exists as an appearance (vivarta) but not as a second independent reality. Like gold ornaments are nothing but gold in different forms, all forms are nothing but Brahman appearing as multiplicity. Everything is 'maya-matra' (merely Maya)—not absolutely non-existent (like a square circle), but dependently existent (like a dream). The body, mind, world—'sarvam kalpitam' (all imagined/superimposed). This doesn't mean they're mental fantasies, but that they're dependent appearances with no existence apart from Brahman, like waves having no existence apart from water. This is ajati-vada (the doctrine of non-creation): nothing was ever really created; the one Brahman alone IS, appearing as many through the magic of Maya."

    transliteration: "ekamevādvitīyaṁ brahma neha nānāsti kiñcit | satyaṁ jñānamanantaṁ yattadevāhamasmi cidrūpo'haṁ sadā śivarūpaḥ ||",
    translation: "Brahman is one without a second; there is no multiplicity whatsoever here. That which is Truth, Knowledge, and Infinity—that alone I am. I am always of the nature of Pure Consciousness and Auspiciousness.",
    commentary: "This verse quotes the Chandogya Upanishad: 'Ekam eva advitiyam Brahma' (Brahman is one without a second). Advaita (non-duality) doesn't mean 'everything is one' (that would still imply many things unified), but 'only One IS' (there are no many to be unified). The appearance of multiplicity is denied: 'neha nanasti kinchit' (here there is no diversity at all). 'Here' means in reality, in truth—diversity exists in appearance but not in essence. The Taittiriya Upanishad defines Brahman as 'Satyam Jnanam Anantam' (Truth, Knowledge, Infinite). Truth (satya): unchanging reality. Knowledge (jnana): self-aware consciousness. Infinite (ananta): unlimited by time, space, or objects. This is not a description of God as a separate being, but the nature of the Self—'that alone I am.' Every seeker must make this journey from 'I am the body' to 'I am Brahman,' from limitation to infinity, from ignorance to knowledge, from seeming to being."

    transliteration: "anādimadhyandhanaṁ nirākāraṁ nirāmayam | nirviśeṣaṁ viśuddhātmarūpaṁ cidrūpo'haṁ sadā śivarūpaḥ ||",
    translation: "I am without beginning, middle, or end; without form; free from disease; without distinguishing features; of the nature of the absolutely pure Self. I am always of the nature of Pure Consciousness and Auspiciousness.",
    commentary: "This verse describes the eternal nature of the Self. Without beginning (anadi): never created, always existing. Without middle (madhya): unchanging, not evolving or developing. Without end (nidhana): never destroyed, deathless. This triad negates time—the Self is beyond past, present, future. Without form (nirakara): unmanifest, beyond all shapes and appearances. Free from disease (niramaya): the body gets sick, but the Self is eternally healthy, perfect. Without distinguishing features (nirvisesha): the body-mind has countless characteristics (tall/short, intelligent/dull, etc.), but the Self has none—it's the featureless ground of all features. 'Vishuddha atma-rupa' (nature of the absolutely pure Self): unstained by any experience, untouched by the world, like space that remains pure whether a slum or palace exists in it. This is the eternal Self—not far away in heaven or to be attained in the future, but the very core of what you are right now."

    translation: "My unmanifest nature shines everywhere as oneness. The entire universe is of the nature of my radiance, my illumination. I am always of the nature of Pure Consciousness and Auspiciousness.",
    commentary: "This concluding verse presents the ultimate vision: the entire universe is the radiance (bhasa) of Consciousness. Everything that appears—every object, every being, every experience—is the light of Consciousness manifesting in various forms. Just as the sun's light takes on the colors of objects (red, blue, green) though the light itself is colorless, Consciousness appears as all forms though itself formless. 'My unmanifest nature shines everywhere as oneness'—the invisible Consciousness is the visible universe, the unmanifest is the manifest, the formless is all forms. This is not pantheism (God = universe) but the Advaitic vision: universe = appearance of Brahman in Brahman, never apart from Brahman. The teaching ends where it began: 'Chid-rupa aham sada Shiva-rupa'—I am always of the nature of Pure Consciousness and Auspiciousness. What began as a dialogue has become a song of realization, a proclamation of truth from one who knows beyond doubt: I am That."
