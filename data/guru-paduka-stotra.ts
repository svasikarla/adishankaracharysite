    sanskrit: "अनन्तसंसारसमुद्रतारनौकायिताभ्यां गुरुभक्तिदाभ्याम्। वैराग्यसाम्राज्यदपूजनाभ्यां नमो नमः श्रीगुरुपादुकाभ्याम्॥",
    transliteration: "anantasaṁsārasamudratāranaukāyitābhyāṁ gurubhaktidābhyām | vairāgyasāmrājyadapūjanābhyāṁ namo namaḥ śrīgurupādukābhyām ||",
    translation: "Salutations again and again to the sacred sandals of the Guru, which serve as the boat to cross the endless ocean of samsara, which bestow devotion to the Guru, and which grant the kingdom of dispassion (vairagya).",
    commentary: "The first verse establishes the guru's feet as the means to liberation. Samsara (the cycle of birth and death) is compared to an endless ocean—vast, turbulent, difficult to cross. The guru's sandals are the boat that carries us across safely. This isn't mere poetry; it represents the practical truth that the guru's teachings are the vehicle for liberation. The verse also connects three key elements: the guru's grace (symbolized by the sandals), devotion (bhakti) to the guru, and dispassion (vairagya) toward worldly objects. True devotion to the guru naturally cultivates dispassion, because when we taste the nectar of spiritual truth, worldly pleasures lose their appeal. The 'kingdom of vairagya' suggests that dispassion is not a loss but a gain—it's a state of supreme freedom and sovereignty."

    sanskrit: "कवित्ववाराशिनिशाकराभ्यां दौर्भाग्यदावाम्बुदमालिकाभ्याम्। दूरीकृतानम्रविपत्तितिभ्यां नमो नमः श्रीगुरुपादुकाभ्याम्॥",
    transliteration: "kavitvavārāśiniśākarābhyāṁ daurbhāgyadāvāmbudamālikābhyām | dūrīkṛtānamravipatitibhyāṁ namo namaḥ śrīgurupādukābhyām ||",
    translation: "Salutations to the sacred sandals of the Guru, which are like the full moon that creates the high tide of poetic wisdom, which are like rain clouds that extinguish the forest fire of misfortune, and which remove all calamities for those who surrender to them.",
    commentary: "This verse uses beautiful nature imagery. The full moon (nishakara) creates high tides in the ocean (of poetic expression and wisdom). Similarly, the guru's grace causes an outpouring of knowledge and eloquent expression of truth. The second image: misfortune (daurbhagya) is like a devastating forest fire, and the guru's sandals are like rain clouds that put out this fire. Just as rain brings relief and renewal, the guru's teachings bring peace and transformation. The final line emphasizes surrender—calamities are removed not just by proximity to the guru, but by 'anamra' (bowing down, surrendering). This humble attitude of surrender is essential. The ego must bow before knowledge can be received."

    sanskrit: "नताजनाभीष्टततिप्रदाभ्यां नमो नमः श्रीगुरुपादुकाभ्याम्। नानाविमोहादिनिवारिकाभ्यां नमो नमः श्रीगुरुपादुकाभ्याम्॥",
    transliteration: "natājanābhīṣṭatatipradābhyāṁ namo namaḥ śrīgurupādukābhyām | nānāvimohādināvārikābhyāṁ namo namaḥ śrīgurupādukābhyām ||",
    translation: "Salutations to the sacred sandals of the Guru, which bestow upon devotees all that they desire and need, and which remove all various forms of delusion and confusion.",
    commentary: "The guru fulfills the true needs of the disciple, though not necessarily all wants. A genuine guru gives what we need for spiritual progress, which may differ from what our ego desires. The 'abhishta' (desires) that are fulfilled are those aligned with our highest good. The second part addresses the removal of 'vimoh' (delusion/confusion). We live in countless delusions: about who we are, what will make us happy, what is real and unreal. The guru's teaching cuts through all these layers of confusion. The word 'nana' (various) indicates that delusions are many and varied—gross and subtle, intellectual and emotional. The guru's wisdom addresses and removes them all, layer by layer, until only truth remains."

    sanskrit: "पापान्धकारार्कपरम्पराभ्यां तापत्रयाहीन्द्रखगेश्वराभ्याम्। जाड्याब्धिसंशोषणवाड़वाभ्यां नमो नमः श्रीगुरुपादुकाभ्याम्॥",
    transliteration: "pāpāndhakārārkaparamparābhyāṁ tāpatrayāhīndrakhageśvarābhyām | jāḍyābdhisaṁśoṣaṇavāḍavābhyāṁ namo namaḥ śrīgurupādukābhyām ||",
    translation: "Salutations to the sacred sandals of the Guru, which are like the succession of suns that dispel the darkness of sins, which are like Garuda (the king of birds) that destroy the serpent of the three types of suffering, and which are like the submarine fire that dries up the ocean of dullness.",
    commentary: "Three powerful metaphors describe the transformative power of the guru's grace. First, sins (papa) create darkness that obscures our true nature. The guru's teachings are like the rising sun that dispels this darkness, revealing what was always there. Second, the three types of suffering (tapa-traya) are: adhyatmika (suffering from one's own body-mind), adhibhautika (suffering from other beings), and adhidaivika (suffering from natural/divine causes—disease, natural disasters, etc.). These sufferings are compared to a serpent, and the guru's sandals to Garuda, the natural enemy of serpents, who crushes them effortlessly. Third, spiritual dullness (jadya)—lack of viveka (discrimination), lethargy, tamasic nature—is compared to an ocean. The guru's teaching is like the vadava fire (submarine fire of cosmic dissolution) that can dry up even the ocean. These vivid images convey the guru's power to completely transform the disciple."

    sanskrit: "शमादिषट्कप्रदवैभवाभ्यां समाधिदानव्रताद िक्षाभ्याम्। रमाधवांघ्रिस्थिरभक्तिदाभ्यां नमो नमः श्रीगुरुपादुकाभ्याम्॥",
    transliteration: "śamādiṣaṭkapradavaibhavābhyāṁ samādhidānavratadīkṣābhyām | ramādhavāṅghristhirabhaktidābhyāṁ namo namaḥ śrīgurupādukābhyām ||",
    translation: "Salutations to the sacred sandals of the Guru, which bestow the glorious wealth of the six virtues beginning with 'shama,' which give the vow and initiation of samadhi, and which grant steady devotion to the feet of Lord Vishnu (Ramadhava).",
    commentary: "This verse emphasizes the ethical and meditative preparation needed for Self-knowledge. The 'shat-sampatti' (six-fold wealth) starting with shama includes: (1) Shama—mental calmness, (2) Dama—sense control, (3) Uparati—withdrawal from worldly pursuits, (4) Titiksha—forbearance, (5) Shraddha—faith, (6) Samadhana—concentration. These are essential qualifications for a spiritual seeker, and the guru cultivates them in the disciple. Samadhi (deep meditative absorption) is presented as both a discipline (vrata) and an initiation (diksha)—indicating it's both effort and grace. Finally, the verse connects jnana (knowledge) with bhakti (devotion). The guru establishes steady devotion to 'Ramadhava' (Vishnu, the all-pervading reality). This shows that Advaita is not dry intellectualism but includes devotion to the formless Brahman through its various forms."

    sanskrit: "स्वारज्यदण्डाभ्युदयप्रदाभ्यां चतुर्विधायुष्मतिदायकाभ्याम्। सम्भक्तिमुक्तियुगलप्रदाभ्यां नमो नमः श्रीगुरुपादुकाभ्याम्॥",
    transliteration: "svārājyadaṇḍābhyudayapradābhyāṁ caturvidhāyuṣmatidāyakābhyām | sambhaktimuktiyugalapradābhyāṁ namo namaḥ śrīgurupādukābhyām ||",
    translation: "Salutations to the sacred sandals of the Guru, which bestow the scepter of self-mastery and prosperity, which grant the four types of wisdom, and which give both devotion and liberation together.",
    commentary: "Self-mastery (svarajya) means being a sovereign in one's own kingdom—not ruled by desires, fears, or external circumstances. This is true freedom. The 'danda' (scepter/staff) represents authority and power, but here it's the power over oneself, which is the greatest power. The 'four types of wisdom' (chaturvidha ayush) likely refer to: physical well-being, mental well-being, spiritual well-being, and complete integration. Alternatively, it could mean the four purusharthas rightly understood: dharma as truth, artha as spiritual wealth, kama as desire for liberation, and moksha as freedom itself. Most significantly, this verse reconciles bhakti and mukti—devotion and liberation. Often seen as separate paths, here they're presented as 'yugala' (a pair, like a divine couple)—inseparable. True devotion leads to liberation, and true liberation includes the flowering of pure love. The guru's grace brings both."

    transliteration: "pāpakṣayadraṣṭakṛtapramohābhyāṁ vidheyaśīghraphaladāyakābhyām | viśvāprāptīcchāparipūrakābhyāṁ namo namaḥ śrīgurupādukābhyām ||",
    translation: "Salutations to the sacred sandals of the Guru, which destroy sins and the delusion created by them, which quickly give the fruits of prescribed practices, and which fulfill the desire to attain the Supreme (Vishva).",
    commentary: "Sin (papa) here means actions that bind us to samsara—not necessarily 'moral evil' in a Western sense, but actions performed in ignorance of our true nature. These create further delusion (pramoha), binding us tighter. The guru's teaching breaks this cycle: wisdom destroys sin, and the destruction of sin allows wisdom to shine. The verse also addresses the practical concern of spiritual practice: when will I see results? The guru's grace ensures that genuine practice (vidheya—what is prescribed) bears fruit quickly. This doesn't mean instant enlightenment, but that sincere effort under guidance doesn't go to waste. The final phrase clarifies the ultimate goal: not worldly fulfillment, but attainment of 'Vishva' (the all, the Supreme)—complete Self-realization. The guru's sandals fulfill this, the highest desire."

    sanskrit: "अनन्तभक्तित्यतिशयाक्षिताभ्यां ध्यानावस्थातत्त्ववबोधकाभ्याम्। मुनिध्यनाभीष्टपदप्रदाभ्यां नमो नमः श्रीगुरुपादुकाभ्याम्॥",
    transliteration: "anantabhaktyatiśayākṣitābhyāṁ dhyānāvasthātattva vabhodhakābhyām | munidhyānābhīṣṭapadapradābhyāṁ namo namaḥ śrīgurupādukābhyām ||",
    translation: "Salutations to the sacred sandals of the Guru, which grant unlimited and ever-increasing devotion, which reveal the truth in the state of meditation, and which bestow the desired goal meditated upon by sages.",
    commentary: "This concluding verse brings together devotion, meditation, and wisdom. Devotion (bhakti) to the guru is described as 'ananta' (endless) and 'atiśaya' (ever-increasing)—indicating that as one progresses, devotion doesn't decrease but deepens. This is natural: as we receive more from the guru, gratitude and love grow. The verse then addresses meditation (dhyana-avastha): in deep meditation, the tattva (ultimate truth/reality) is revealed. This isn't intellectual knowledge but direct experience of non-dual awareness. The guru's teaching guides us to this experiential understanding. Finally, what the great sages (muni) meditate upon—what they consider the 'abhishta pada' (desired state)—is granted. What do sages desire? Not worldly pleasures, but liberation, Self-knowledge, permanent peace. The guru's sandals—symbolizing complete surrender to the guru's wisdom—lead to this supreme goal. Thus the hymn concludes with the assurance that devoted practice under the guru's guidance leads certainly to realization."
