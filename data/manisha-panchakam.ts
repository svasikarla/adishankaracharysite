    sanskrit: "जाग्रत्स्वप्नसुषुप्तिषु स्फुटतरा या संविदुज्ज्रृम्भते या ब्रह्मादिपिपीलिकान्तषु सदा व्याप्तानुभूयमाना। तां निर्विश्यमवाप्तलक्ष्य निगमैर्यत्सर्वभूताधिवासा यस्तां वेत्ति स वेद वेदमिति वा मन्ये स वै निष्कलः॥",
    transliteration: "jāgratsvapnasuṣuptiṣu sphuṭatarā yā saṁvidujjṛmbhate yā brahmādipipīlikāntaṣu sadā vyāptānubhūyamānā | tāṁ nirviśyamavāptalakṣya nigamairyatsarvabhūtādhivāsā yastaṁ vetti sa veda vedamiti vā manye sa vai niṣkalaḥ ||",
    translation: "He alone knows the Vedas who realizes that Consciousness which shines clearly in the waking, dream, and deep sleep states; which pervades everything from Brahma (the creator) down to the ant; which is experienced as all-pervading; and which is described in the Vedas as the inner dweller of all beings. Such a person is beyond all parts and divisions.",
    commentary: "Shankaracharya here defines what it means to truly 'know' the Vedas. It's not about memorizing texts, performing rituals, or scholarly learning. True Vedic knowledge is the direct realization of the one Consciousness (Samvit) that illumines all three states of experience. This Consciousness is what makes waking, dreaming, and deep sleep possible—it is their witness and substratum. The same Consciousness pervades all beings, from the highest god (Brahma) to the smallest insect (ant), indicating absolute equality and non-duality. The Upanishads declare this truth: 'Tat Tvam Asi' (You are That). He who realizes this experientially—not just intellectually—is 'nishkala' (partless, complete, whole). Such a person has transcended all divisions of caste, creed, and social status because they see the one Self in all."

    sanskrit: "ब्रह्मैवाहमिदं जगच्च सकलं चिन्मात्रविस्तारितं सर्वं चैतदविद्यया त्रिगुणयात्मन्येकमेवाध्यसितम्। यत्स्यात्प्रक्रितिवाच्यमप्यविदितं यत्स्वात्मतत्त्वं प्रति यस्तं वेत्ति स वेद वेदमिति वा मन्ये स वै निष्कलः॥",
    transliteration: "brahmaivāhamidaṁ jagacca sakalaṁ cinmātravistāritaṁ sarvaṁ caitadavidyayā triguṇayātmanyekamevādhyasitam | yatsyātprakṛtivācyamapyaviditaṁ yatsvātmatatvaṁ prati yastaṁ vetti sa veda vedamiti vā manye sa vai niṣkalaḥ ||",
    translation: "I am indeed Brahman, and this entire universe is nothing but an expansion of Pure Consciousness. All this diversity is superimposed on the one Self by ignorance through the three gunas (qualities of nature). Whatever appears as nature or matter is ultimately unreal when compared to one's own true nature as the Self. He who knows this knows the Vedas; such a person is complete and partless.",
    commentary: "This verse presents the core Advaita teaching: 'Brahmaivāham' (I am indeed Brahman). The entire universe, in all its multiplicity, is an appearance in Consciousness, like waves in the ocean or images in a mirror. The diversity we perceive is not ultimately real—it's a superimposition (adhyasa) created by ignorance (avidya) operating through the three gunas (sattva, rajas, tamas). Just as a rope is mistaken for a snake in dim light, the one non-dual Brahman is mistaken for the manifold universe. What we call 'matter' or 'nature' (prakriti) has no independent existence apart from Consciousness. When this truth is directly realized—not just believed—one recognizes their essential identity with Brahman. This is the complete knowledge; one who has this is 'nishkala' (whole, lacking nothing)."

    sanskrit: "शश्वन्नः श्वपचः स्वपाच इति गत्वा तु ब्राह्मणत्वं तथैव नित्यं ब्रह्म निरन्तरं पवनमेको हि सन्तः। सम्भावितः खलु तदा भवति यस्मिन्नपि प्रत्ययः यस्तं वेत्ति स वेद वेदमिति वा मन्ये स वै निष्कलः॥",
    transliteration: "śaśvannaḥ śvapacaḥ svapāca iti gatvā tu brāhmaṇatvaṁ tathaiva nityaṁ brahma nirantaraṁ pavanameko hi santaḥ | sambhāvitaḥ khalu tadā bhavati yasminnapi pratyayaḥ yastaṁ vetti sa veda vedamiti vā manye sa vai niṣkalaḥ ||",
    translation: "Whether one is born in a family of outcastes (chandala) or in a Brahmin family, he who has the firm conviction that 'I am the eternal, ever-pure, unbroken Brahman,' and in whom this realization is firmly established—he alone knows the Vedas. Such a person is complete and partless.",
    commentary: "This revolutionary verse was prompted by Shankaracharya's encounter with a chandala (outcaste). When asked to move aside, the outcaste posed a profound question: 'Do you want my body to move or the Atman?' This question awakened Shankaracharya to recognize his own subtle attachment to social identity. The verse declares that caste, birth, and social status are entirely irrelevant to spiritual realization. What matters is the firm conviction (pratyaya) in one's identity as Brahman—the eternal, pure, undivided Reality. Whether born as an outcaste or a Brahmin, rich or poor, man or woman—these are merely temporary costumes worn by the one Consciousness. The person who has transcended these superficial identifications and rests in the awareness 'I am Brahman' has true Vedic knowledge. This is Shankaracharya's explicit teaching on spiritual equality."

    sanskrit: "सर्वत्र भाति चिदिदं जडमस्ति चिच्छक्तिः प्रकाशते न परमं पश्यतां तु रूपं। भिन्नं यदा जडरसं नियतं विचित्य यस्तं वेत्ति स वेद वेदमिति वा मन्ये स वै निष्कलः॥",
    transliteration: "sarvatra bhāti cidīdaṁ jaḍamasti cicchaktiḥ prakāśate na paramaṁ paśyatāṁ tu rūpaṁ | bhinnaṁ yadā jaḍarasaṁ niyataṁ vicitrya yastaṁ vetti sa veda vedamiti vā manye sa vai niṣkalaḥ ||",
    translation: "Consciousness shines everywhere; what appears as inert matter exists only because of the power of Consciousness. To those who see clearly, there is no separate existence of matter apart from Consciousness. He who discriminates and understands that the inert (jada) has no independent reality separate from Consciousness (Chit)—he knows the Vedas. Such a person is complete.",
    commentary: "This verse teaches the relationship between Consciousness (Chit) and matter (Jada). At first glance, the world appears to be made of inert, unconscious matter—rocks, trees, bodies. But upon deeper inquiry, we find that even this 'matter' is known only through Consciousness. Without Consciousness, can you prove matter exists? In deep sleep, the entire material world disappears because Consciousness withdraws from it. This suggests that matter has no independent existence—it's like a dream that exists only for the dreamer. The power of Consciousness (Chit-Shakti) alone creates the appearance of matter. Just as a movie screen appears to contain mountains, oceans, and people, but is actually just a flat white surface, Consciousness appears as the diverse universe while remaining ever non-dual. The realized person sees through this appearance and recognizes that Consciousness alone IS, and all else is a magical display within it. This discrimination (viveka) between the eternal Consciousness and the temporary appearance is the essence of wisdom."

    sanskrit: "चाण्डालोऽस्तु स तु द्विजोऽस्तु गुरुरित्येषा मनीषा मम चिद्रूपिण एव कारणात् विदितं यत्ते ब्रह्माप्येकः। आशया यदि तत्र च एव भवति प्रत्ययः सत्कृतिः यस्तं वेत्ति स वेद वेदमिति वा मन्ये स वै निष्कलः॥",
    transliteration: "cāṇḍālo'stu sa tu dvijo'stu gururitīyeṣā manīṣā mama cidrūpiṇa eva kāraṇāt viditaṁ yatte brahmāpyekaḥ | āśayā yadi tatra ca eva bhavati pratyayaḥ satkṛtiḥ yastaṁ vetti sa veda vedamiti vā manye sa vai niṣkalaḥ ||",
    translation: "Whether one is a chandala (outcaste) or a twice-born Brahmin—if he has the firm realization that 'I am of the nature of Consciousness,' then he is my guru. This is my conviction. Because of this understanding that Brahman is one and all are that Consciousness, such a person is worthy of highest respect. He who knows this knows the Vedas; such a person is complete.",
    commentary: "This concluding verse is Shankaracharya's revolutionary declaration of spiritual equality. In a society rigidly stratified by caste, he proclaims that even a chandala (the lowest in the social hierarchy) is his guru if that person has realized their identity as pure Consciousness (Chit-Rupa). Conversely, even a Brahmin priest without this realization is not truly wise. What qualifies someone as a guru is not birth, social status, wealth, or ritual purity—it is Self-knowledge alone. This is 'manisha' (conviction/wisdom)—the recognition that the same Brahman dwells in all beings without distinction. When one sees the same Consciousness in the outcaste and the priest, in the saint and the sinner, in the human and the animal, one has true Vedic wisdom. This verse concludes the teaching: real knowledge is the recognition of non-dual Consciousness as one's own Self and as the Self of all. Such a person deserves 'satkruti' (highest honor), regardless of external factors. This is the essence of Advaita Vedanta: 'Sarvaṁ khalvidaṁ brahma'—All this is indeed Brahman."
