    sanskrit: "विश्वं दर्पणदृश्यमाननगरीतुल्यं निजान्तर्गतं पश्यन्नात्मनि मायया बहिरिवोद्भूतं यथा निद्रया। यः साक्षात्कुरुते प्रबोधसमये स्वात्मानमेवाद्वयं तस्मै श्रीगुरुमूर्तये नम इदं श्रीदक्षिणामूर्तये॥",
    transliteration: "viśvaṁ darpaṇadṛśyamānanāgarītulyaṁ nijāntargataṁ paśyannātmani māyayā bahirivodbhūtaṁ yathā nidrayā | yaḥ sākṣātkurute prabodhasamaye svātmānamevādvayaṁ tasmai śrīgurumūrtaye nama idaṁ śrīdakṣiṇāmūrtaye ||",
    translation: "Salutations to Sri Dakshinamurti, who is the embodiment of the supreme Guru, who enables one to realize at the time of awakening that the entire universe—which during ignorance appears to exist outside like a city reflected in a mirror or like dream objects that seem external during sleep—is in reality not separate from one's own Self, and who thus reveals the non-dual Self.",
    commentary: "This opening verse presents the central teaching through a beautiful analogy. Just as a city reflected in a mirror appears to be separate from the mirror but is actually nothing but the mirror's surface, the entire universe appears to be separate from Consciousness but is actually nothing but Consciousness itself. Similarly, in a dream, objects seem to be outside and independent, but upon waking, we realize they were all creations of our own mind—they had no existence outside our consciousness. This is exactly what happens in spiritual awakening: what we thought was an external, independent universe is recognized as a projection within our own limitless Consciousness. The world doesn't disappear upon enlightenment, but it is recognized for what it truly is—not separate from the Self. Dakshinamurti, through his silent teaching, enables this direct realization (sakshatkara) of the non-dual Self."

    translation: "Salutations to Sri Dakshinamurti, who is the embodiment of the Guru, who manifests this universe—which existed in its causal, undifferentiated state like a tree within a seed—into its variegated form through Maya's creation of differences in space, time, and causation, just as a magician creates illusions or a great yogi manifests forms at will.",
    commentary: "This verse addresses the question: How does the one Brahman appear as the many? The answer is given through the seed-tree analogy. Before a tree manifests, it exists in potential form within the seed—undifferentiated, not yet expressed as trunk, branches, leaves. Similarly, the entire universe exists in potential, undifferentiated form within Brahman. Through Maya (the creative power of Brahman), this potential becomes expressed through the framework of space (desha), time (kala), and causation (karana). Just as a magician creates illusions of many objects while there's actually only rope, cloth, and sleight of hand, Brahman creates the illusion of multiplicity while remaining ever non-dual. Importantly, this manifestation happens by His will (sveccha)—effortlessly, playfully, like a yogi manifesting siddhis. This is not a real transformation of Brahman (which is impossible), but an apparent transformation, a cosmic play (lila)."

    sanskrit: "यस्यैव स्फुरणं सदात्मकमसत्-कल्पार्थ-काप्यं भवेत् यस्मिन्नहो जगत्पश्यति काल-कल्पनाधिकारे यथा। सर्वात्मानमेवं सत्यं परम परित्यज्य तदन्यत् तस्मै श्रीगुरुमूर्तये नम इदं श्रीदक्षिणामूर्तये॥",
    transliteration: "yasyaiva sphuraṇaṁ sadātmakamasatkalpārthakāpyaṁ bhavet yasminnaḥ jagatpaśyati kāla-kalpanādhikāre yathā | sarvātmānamēvaṁ satyaṁ parama parityajya tadanyat tasmai śrīgurumūrtaye nama idaṁ śrīdakṣiṇāmūrtaye ||",
    translation: "Salutations to Sri Dakshinamurti, in whose consciousness alone the unreal universe appears real through imagination, like dream objects appear real during sleep. When one realizes that He is the Self of all and the ultimate truth, all else is abandoned as unreal.",
    commentary: "This verse explains the epistemological status of the universe. The world is neither completely real (like Brahman) nor completely unreal (like a square circle). It's 'mithya'—dependent reality, like a dream. In whose consciousness does this dependent reality appear? In Brahman alone—more specifically, in the reflection of Brahman called Jiva. The example of dreams is again used: during a dream, we create an entire world—people, places, experiences—that seems completely real. We don't doubt it while dreaming. Similarly, while in ignorance (avidya), the world seems absolutely real and external. But upon awakening to Self-knowledge, we realize that just as dream objects had no existence outside the dreamer's mind, the universe has no existence outside Brahman. This doesn't mean the world is abolished—waves don't disappear when you realize they're water. But the understanding fundamentally shifts: from 'the world is independently real' to 'the world is a dependent appearance in Brahman.'"

    translation: "Salutations to Sri Dakshinamurti, whose light of knowledge shines through the various openings of the sense organs (eyes, ears, etc.) like the light of a great lamp inside a pot shines through its holes. 'I know'—it is because of His light alone that the entire universe shines and is experienced.",
    commentary: "This verse addresses the nature of knowledge and consciousness. Imagine a pot with several holes, with a lamp inside. The light shines out through each hole, illuminating different directions. Similarly, Consciousness (the inner lamp) shines through the various sense organs (the holes), enabling us to see through eyes, hear through ears, taste through tongue. The crucial point: it's the same one Consciousness illumining all experiences. When you say 'I see,' 'I hear,' 'I think,' the 'I'—the knower—is the same in all cases. This Consciousness is self-luminous (svayam-prakasha); it doesn't need another consciousness to be conscious of it. Just as a lamp doesn't need another lamp to be visible, Consciousness doesn't need to be 'known'—it IS the knowing itself. Every act of knowing is actually Consciousness knowing itself through various instruments. The entire universe is 'known' only because Consciousness illumines it. Without this light of Awareness, nothing could be experienced. Thus, Consciousness is the ultimate subject, never an object."

    translation: "Salutations to Sri Dakshinamurti, who is the embodiment of the Guru, who destroys the great delusion created by the play of Maya's power. Those who argue 'I am the body,' 'I am the prana,' 'I am the senses,' 'I am the mind,' or 'I am void/nothing' are greatly deluded, like women, children, the blind, and the inert.",
    commentary: "This verse critiques various wrong identifications and materialist/nihilist philosophies. The gross error is identifying with the body: 'I am this man/woman,' 'I am young/old,' 'I am sick/healthy.' Subtler is identifying with prana (life-energy): 'I am alive,' 'I am energetic/tired.' Even subtler is identifying with the mind-intellect complex: 'I am my thoughts,' 'I am intelligent/dull.' The verse also critiques the Buddhist Shunya-vada (void doctrine) which posits ultimate emptiness or nothingness. Advaita says: you are not void—you are the fullness of Consciousness-Existence-Bliss (Sat-Chit-Ananda). The comparison to women, children, blind, and inert is not literal discrimination but indicates levels of ignorance: emotional reactivity, immaturity, lack of discrimination, and complete unconsciousness respectively. The great delusion (maha-vyamoha) is taking the non-Self to be the Self. Dakshinamurti's teaching destroys this fundamental error and reveals what you truly are—the infinite, eternal, blissful Consciousness that witnesses all these temporary phenomena."

    sanskrit: "राहुग्रस्तदिवाकरेन्दुसदृशो माया समाच्छादनात् संसारः प्रभुरेव विद्यतमसाभिभूतो यथा रज्जुतः। रज्ज्वास्तत्त्वविलोकतो विकलशुद्धं किम स्मरेन्मे तस्मै श्रीगुरुमूर्तये नम इदं श्रीदक्षिणामूर्तये॥",
    transliteration: "rāhugrastadivākarendusadṛśo māyā-samācchādanāt saṁsāraḥ prabhureva vidyatamasābhibhūto yathā rajjutaḥ | rajjvāstattvavil-okato vikalaśuddhaṁ kiṁ smarenme tasmai śrīgurumūrtaye nama idaṁ śrīdakṣiṇāmūrtaye ||",
    translation: "Salutations to Sri Dakshinamurti, who reveals that the Self—though ever pure and complete—appears to be bound in samsara due to being covered by Maya, just as the sun or moon appears to be swallowed during an eclipse by Rahu though they remain unaffected, or like a rope that appears to be a snake due to darkness but is revealed as merely rope when properly seen.",
    commentary: "This profound verse uses two analogies to explain the relationship between the Self and ignorance. First, the eclipse analogy: during a solar or lunar eclipse, the celestial body appears to be 'swallowed' by the shadow (Rahu in Indian astronomy). But in reality, the sun/moon remains completely unaffected—it's only from the observer's perspective that darkness seems to obscure the light. Similarly, the Self is never actually bound, tainted, or affected by Maya—it only appears so from the perspective of ignorance. Second, the rope-snake analogy: in dim light, a rope is mistaken for a snake, causing fear. But when light is brought, we see it was always just a rope—the snake never existed. Similarly, when the light of knowledge dawns, we see we were always the free, pure Self—bondage never actually existed. These are classic Advaita examples showing that liberation is not acquiring something new but recognizing what always is. You don't have to 'become' enlightened; you have to recognize you are already the free, limitless Consciousness."

    sanskrit: "बाल्यादिष्वपि जाग्रदादिषु तथा सर्वास्ववस्थास्वपि व्यावृत्तासु अनुवर्तमानमहमित्यन्तः स्फुरणं सदा। स्वात्मानं प्रकटीकरोति भजतां यो मुद्रया भद्रया तस्मै श्रीगुरुमूर्तये नम इदं श्रीदक्षिणामूर्तये॥",
    transliteration: "bālyādiṣvapi jāgradādiṣu tathā sarvāsvavasthāsvapi vyāvṛttāsu anuvartamānamahamityantaḥ sphuraṇaṁ sadā | svātmānaṁ prakaṭīkaroti bhajatāṁ yo mudrayā bhadrayā tasmai śrīgurumūrtaye nama idaṁ śrīdakṣiṇāmūrtaye ||",
    translation: "Salutations to Sri Dakshinamurti, who reveals one's own Self through the auspicious sign of Chin Mudra (hand gesture of knowledge). He who reveals that constant inner shining of 'I-I' which continues unchanged through all stages of life (childhood, youth, old age) and through all states of consciousness (waking, dreaming, deep sleep).",
    commentary: "This verse points to the unchanging witness-consciousness that persists through all changes. Consider: you were a child, then a youth, now perhaps middle-aged or old. The body, mind, personality—all have completely changed. Yet there's a continuous sense of 'I' that connects all these stages. The same person who was a child says, 'I am old now.' This indicates an unchanging 'I' that witnesses childhood, youth, and old age. Similarly, through waking, dreaming, and deep sleep, the 'I' persists. You wake up and say, 'I slept well'—the same 'I' that now experiences waking was present in deep sleep (otherwise, how could you remember it?). This constant, unchanging 'I'—this pure sense of existence-awareness before any attributes are added—is your true nature. Dakshinamurti reveals this through Chin Mudra: the joining of thumb (representing Brahman) and index finger (representing Jiva), showing their ultimate non-difference. The other three fingers (representing the three gunas or three bodies) point away, indicating their unreality. This simple hand gesture encodes the entire teaching of Advaita."

    translation: "Salutations to Sri Dakshinamurti, who guides the person who, deluded by Maya, sees the world in terms of cause and effect, master and servant, teacher and student, father and son, and various other differences, whether in the waking state or dream state.",
    commentary: "This verse describes the various dualities created by Maya. Under the spell of ignorance, we divide reality into countless pairs of opposites: cause-effect (this happened because of that), master-servant (hierarchies of power), teacher-student (knowledge-ignorance), father-son (family relationships), and innumerable other distinctions. We see subject and object, self and other, good and evil, pleasure and pain, mine and yours. Importantly, these dualities exist equally in waking and dreaming. In a dream, you see all these relationships clearly—there's a dreamer and dream objects, there are hierarchies, relationships, causation. But upon waking, you realize all these were false divisions within your own mind. There was never actually a separate dream-person or dream-world—it was all you. Similarly, in the 'waking dream' of ordinary life, all these dualities are ultimately false divisions within the one Consciousness. Dakshinamurti's teaching is meant for this Maya-deluded person, to wake them up to the non-dual reality. Once awakened, all these distinctions are seen as superficial appearances on the surface of the one Self, like waves appearing on the ocean's surface."

    translation: "Salutations to Sri Dakshinamurti, who is the omnipresent supreme Lord, beyond whom nothing else exists upon proper inquiry. The entire universe consisting of moving and unmoving objects—earth, water, fire, air, space, sun, moon, and individual souls—appears as His eightfold form.",
    commentary: "This verse presents the cosmic vision of Advaita: the entire universe is the body of Brahman. The 'eightfold form' (murti-ashtakam) refers to the five great elements (panchamahabhuta: earth, water, fire, air, space) plus sun, moon, and jiva (individual consciousness). All of this—the entire cosmos with its moving beings (cara) and stationary objects (achara)—is a manifestation of the one Brahman. This is not pantheism (the belief that God is the sum total of the universe), but pan-en-theism: the universe exists IN Brahman like waves in the ocean, but Brahman is more than the universe. When properly investigated (vimrishata), no second thing exists apart from Brahman. The world doesn't disappear, but is recognized as non-different from its source. Like gold ornaments are non-different from gold (they're all just gold in different shapes), all forms are non-different from Brahman (they're all just Brahman in different appearances). This is the vision of 'vibhu'—the all-pervading reality. Dakshinamurti leads us to this recognition: wherever you look, it's only Brahman appearing as this or that form."

    translation: "In this hymn, the truth that 'the Self is all' has been clearly revealed. Therefore, by listening to this hymn, by reflecting upon its meaning, by meditating on it, and by singing it, one naturally attains the state of being the Lord (Ishvaratva) with the great glory of being the Self of all. Further, one attains the unobstructed eightfold divine powers.",
    commentary: "This concluding verse is the 'phala-shruti' (fruit of listening), describing the benefits of this stotra. The essential teaching is 'Sarvatmatva'—the realization that the Self is all, that Consciousness alone IS, appearing as all forms. How to attain this? Through four stages: (1) Shravana—listening to the teaching from a guru or scripture, (2) Manana—reflecting upon it, removing doubts through logic and reasoning, (3) Nididhyasana—deep meditation, making the knowledge one's own experience, (4) Sankirtana—singing/chanting, allowing the truth to penetrate the heart. Through this process, one attains 'Ishvaratva'—the state of being the Lord, meaning recognizing one's identity with the supreme Brahman. This is not egoic ('I am God'), but the recognition that there is no separate 'I'—there is only Brahman, appearing as all including this apparent individual. Additionally, the verse mentions 'ashtadha aishvarya'—the eightfold siddhis (supernatural powers): anima (becoming minute), mahima (becoming huge), laghima (becoming light), garima (becoming heavy), prapti (obtaining anything), prakamya (irresistible will), ishitva (lordship), vashitva (control). However, these are incidental—the real fruit is Self-knowledge."
