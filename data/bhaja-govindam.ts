    transliteration: "bhaja govindam bhaja govindam govindam bhaja mūḍhamate | samprāpte sannihite kāle nahi nahi rakṣati ḍukṛñkaraṇe ||",
    translation: "Worship Govinda, worship Govinda, worship Govinda, O fool! Rules of grammar will not save you at the time of your death.",
    commentary: "This opening verse sets the tone for the entire work. Shankaracharya urges us to seek the Divine rather than getting lost in mere intellectual pursuits. The word 'mūḍhamate' (O fool) is used compassionately, addressing those who mistake intellectual knowledge for spiritual wisdom. At death, grammatical expertise ('ḍukṛñkaraṇe' - grammatical rules) will be of no use; only devotion to God (Govinda) will help.",

    transliteration: "mūḍha jahīhi dhanāgatṛṣṇāṁ kuru sadbuddhiṁ manasi vitṛṣṇām | yallabhase nijakarmo​pāttaṁ vittaṁ tena vinodaya cittam ||",
    translation: "O fool! Give up your thirst for wealth. Create in your mind, devoid of passions, thoughts of reality. What you get, be content with that. Let that make you happy.",
    commentary: "Shankaracharya teaches contentment and warns against endless material desires. The pursuit of wealth is insatiable - the more one has, the more one wants. True happiness comes from being content with what comes to us through our karma (past actions). 'Sadbuddhi' means right understanding - the discrimination between the eternal and the transient.",

    transliteration: "nārīstanabhara nābhīdeśaṁ dṛṣṭvā māgā mohāveśam | etanmāṁsavasādivikāraṁ manasi vicintaya vāraṁ vāram ||",
    translation: "Looking at the female form with its fullness and navel, do not fall prey to delusion. Contemplate again and again in your mind that this is but a modification of flesh and fat.",
    commentary: "This verse addresses the power of sensory attractions and bodily desires. Shankaracharya asks us to see beyond superficial physical beauty and recognize the temporary nature of the body. This is not about disrespecting the female form but about understanding the transient nature of all physical manifestations. The practice of viveka (discrimination) helps us see the eternal essence beyond the temporary form.",

    transliteration: "nalinīdalagata jalamatitaralaṁ tadvajjīvitamatiśayacapalam | viddhi vyādhyabhimāna​grastaṁ lokaṁ śokahataṁ ca samastam ||",
    translation: "The life of a person is as uncertain as rain drops trembling on a lotus leaf. Know that the whole world is devoured by disease and conceit and is riddled with pangs.",
    commentary: "This beautiful metaphor compares life to water droplets on a lotus leaf - beautiful but extremely fragile and temporary. The verse reminds us of life's uncertainty and the universal nature of suffering (disease and sorrow). Pride and ego ('abhimāna') only add to our suffering. Understanding this impermanence should motivate us toward spiritual seeking.",

    transliteration: "yāvadvittopārjana saktaḥ tāvannija parivāro raktaḥ | paścājjīvati jarjara dehe vārtāṁ ko'pi na pṛcchati gehe ||",
    translation: "As long as there is the ability to earn and save, so long all your family members are attached to you. Later, when you come to live with an old, infirm body, no one at home cares to speak even a word with you.",
    commentary: "A stark reminder of the conditional nature of worldly relationships. People are often attached not to us but to what we can provide. In old age, when earning capacity ceases, even family members may become indifferent. This is not to create cynicism but to inspire us to seek relationships based on eternal values and ultimately to seek the unchanging Divine, whose love is unconditional.",

    transliteration: "yāvatpavano nivasati dehe tāvatpṛcchati kuśalaṁ gehe | gatavati vāyau dehāpāye bhāryā bibhyati tasminkāye ||",
    translation: "As long as there is breath in the body, people at home enquire about one's welfare. Once the breath (life) leaves, even the wife fears that very same body.",
    commentary: "This verse powerfully illustrates the impermanence of the body and the transitory nature of attachment. The same body that was cherished becomes an object of fear when life departs. This teaches us that we are not the body - we are the eternal consciousness that temporarily inhabits it. Family attachment is to the living person, not to the mere physical form.",

    translation: "Childhood is spent in play, youth in dalliance with the opposite sex, old age passes with anxiety and fear. But hardly anyone is interested in the contemplation of the Supreme Brahman.",
    commentary: "A poignant commentary on how human life is wasted in various distractions at different stages. Children play, youth indulge in sensual pleasures, and old people worry about their fading life - but few turn their attention to the eternal Truth. This verse urges us not to postpone spiritual seeking, as each life stage brings its own distractions.",

    transliteration: "kā te kāntā dhanagata​cintā vātula kiṁ tava nāsti niyantā | trijagati sajjanasamgatiraikā bhavati bhavārṇava​taraṇe naukā ||",
    translation: "O mad man! Why this anxiety about wife and wealth? Is there not a controller of your life? In the three worlds, it is only the association with the good that can serve as a boat to cross the sea of life.",
    commentary: "Shankaracharya questions our excessive worries about family and wealth. There is a Divine controller (God) who manages everything according to karma. Instead of constant anxiety, we should seek the company of saints and sages ('sajjana-sangati'). Good company is described as the boat that helps us cross the ocean of worldly existence (samsara).",

    transliteration: "kā te kāntā kaste putraḥ saṁsāro'yamatīva vicitraḥ | kasya tvaṁ kaḥ kuta āyātaḥ tattvaṁ cintaya tadiha bhrātaḥ ||",
    translation: "Who is your wife? Who is your son? This worldly existence is very strange indeed. Of whom are you? Who are you? From where have you come? Reflect on these truths, O brother!",
    commentary: "Shankaracharya confronts us with fundamental existential questions. In the grand scheme of existence, relationships like husband-wife, parent-child are temporary roles we play. The world (samsara) appears strange and bewildering when examined closely - we come from unknown origins, assume various identities, and depart to unknown destinations. Instead of being lost in these temporary connections, we should inquire into our true nature: 'Who am I really?' This verse urges philosophical inquiry into the nature of existence rather than blind attachment to worldly relationships.",

    transliteration: "satsaṅgatve nissaṅgatvaṁ nissaṅgatve nirmohatvam | nirmohatve niścalatattvaṁ niścalatattve jīvanmuktiḥ ||",
    translation: "From good company comes non-attachment, from non-attachment comes freedom from delusion, from freedom from delusion comes steadiness in truth, from steadiness in truth comes liberation while living.",
    commentary: "This verse presents a beautiful progressive path to liberation. It all begins with satsanga - company of the wise, association with truth-seekers and realized beings. Such company naturally leads to detachment (nissangatva) from worldly pursuits. Detachment removes delusion (moha) - the false beliefs and misidentifications. Freedom from delusion brings stability in truth (nishchala-tattva) - firm establishment in Self-knowledge. This culminates in jivanmukti - liberation while still alive. Each step naturally follows from the previous, showing that spiritual transformation is a systematic process beginning with choosing good company.",

    transliteration: "vayasi gate kaḥ kāmavikāraḥ śuṣke nīre kaḥ kāsāraḥ | kṣīṇe vitte kaḥ parivāraḥ jñāte tattve kaḥ saṁsāraḥ ||",
    translation: "When youth has passed, where is lust and passion? When water has dried, where is the lake? When wealth is gone, where are the relatives? When truth is known, where is worldly existence?",
    commentary: "Four powerful rhetorical questions expose the temporary nature of what we consider important. Physical passion depends on youth and disappears with age. A lake exists only while water remains. Family gathers around wealth but disperses when it's gone. Most profound: when the truth of the Self is realized, the entire concept of worldly bondage (samsara) vanishes - it's seen to have never truly existed. Just as there's no lake without water, there's no samsara for one who knows the truth. This verse urges us to seek what is permanent rather than chase ephemeral pleasures.",

    transliteration: "mā kuru dhanajana​yauvanagarvaṁ harati nimeṣātkālaḥ sarvam | māyāmayamidamakhilaṁ hitvā brahmapadaṁ tvaṁ praviśa viditvā ||",
    translation: "Do not be proud of wealth, friends, and youth. Time destroys all these in a moment. Knowing this entire world to be made of maya (illusion), enter into the state of Brahman.",
    commentary: "Pride (garva) in wealth, social connections, and youth is misplaced because time (kala) can destroy all these instantly - through economic collapse, relationships ending, or aging. The verse reveals that this entire phenomenal world is mayamaya - made of illusion, not ultimately real. Understanding this impermanence and illusory nature, one should seek refuge in Brahman - the only permanent reality. This is not pessimism but wisdom - recognizing what is truly valuable. Instead of building identity on shifting sands, establish yourself in the eternal truth.",

    transliteration: "dinayāminyau sāyaṁ prātaḥ śiśiravasantau punarāyātaḥ | kālaḥ krīḍati gacchatyāyustadapi na muñcatyāśāvāyuḥ ||",
    translation: "Day and night, evening and morning, winter and spring come again and again. Time plays, life passes away, yet the wind of desires never leaves.",
    commentary: "The verse paints a picture of the relentless march of time. Days, nights, seasons cycle endlessly - time is 'playing' (kreeda) with us, and life is slipping away moment by moment. Despite witnessing this constant passage and the certainty of death, the 'wind of desires' (asha-vayu) continues to blow in the mind. We see others age and die, yet somehow believe we are exempt. This verse is a wake-up call: time waits for no one. While there's still time, turn from endless desires toward the eternal truth. Don't let death arrive while you're still caught in the net of unfulfilled wants.",

    translation: "This teaching with the twelve verses (Dvadasha Manjarika) was completely taught to the grammarian by the revered Shankaracharya, who is skilled in all knowledge.",
    commentary: "This verse serves as a transition, indicating that the main teaching to the old grammarian is complete. The 'twelve verses' (dvadasha manjarika) refers to additional verses that were composed by Shankaracharya's disciples who witnessed this encounter. These supplementary verses expand on the same themes - the futility of mere intellectual knowledge and the urgency of spiritual seeking. The verse honors Shankaracharya as one who is accomplished in all vidyas (knowledge) yet emphasizes that liberation comes not from grammar but from Self-knowledge.",

    transliteration: "kuru puṇyamahorātraṁ paśya nityamanityam | nāma smara nityamanityaṁ kāmamuktvā priyaṁ viṣayam ||",
    translation: "Do good deeds day and night, discern between the eternal and the non-eternal. Constantly remember the divine name, having given up desire for sense pleasures.",
    commentary: "This verse gives practical guidance for spiritual life. First, engage in virtuous actions (punya) continuously - not occasionally but as a way of life. Second, develop discrimination (viveka) between what is eternal (Brahman, the Self) and what is temporary (everything else). Third, practice constant remembrance of God through nama-smarana (chanting divine names). Fourth, cultivate dispassion (vairagya) toward sensory pleasures. These four practices - right action, discrimination, devotion, and renunciation - together prepare the mind for Self-knowledge. They are not the goal itself but essential preparation for realization.",

    transliteration: "geyaṁ gītānāmasahasraṁ dhyeyaṁ śrīpatirūpamajasram | neyaṁ sajjanasaṅge cittaṁ deyaṁ dīnajanāya ca vittam ||",
    translation: "Sing the name of God constantly, meditate unceasingly on the form of the Lord. Keep your mind in the company of the good, and give your wealth to the needy.",
    commentary: "Four practical disciplines for daily life are prescribed: (1) Constant singing/chanting of divine names - making devotion a continuous practice, not limited to formal worship times; (2) Unceasing meditation on the divine form - keeping awareness of the Divine throughout activities; (3) Keeping company with the virtuous (satsanga) - surrounding yourself with those who uplift and inspire; (4) Charity toward the poor - using wealth for service rather than selfish accumulation. These practices purify the heart, reduce ego, and create favorable conditions for spiritual growth. Together they constitute a balanced path combining devotion, meditation, good company, and selfless service.",

    transliteration: "sukhataḥ kriyate rāmābhogaḥ paścāddhanta śarīre rogaḥ | yadyapi loke maraṇaṁ śaraṇaṁ tadapi na muñcati pāpācaraṇam ||",
    translation: "Sense pleasures are indulged in with delight, but later diseases afflict the body. Though death is the ultimate refuge in this world, still one does not give up sinful actions.",
    commentary: "This verse exposes human folly. We pursue sense pleasures (bhoga) thinking they bring happiness, but they often result in disease - both physical ailments and mental afflictions. Despite knowing that death is inevitable (marana is everyone's final 'refuge'), people don't abandon harmful behaviors. We see others suffer consequences of wrong actions, yet continue the same patterns ourselves. This is the power of ignorance (avidya) and desire (kama). The verse implies we should learn from universal experience rather than personal suffering. Wisdom means changing course before hitting the wall, not after. Turn toward righteousness (dharma) now, while there's time.",

    transliteration: "arthamanarthaṁ bhāvaya nityaṁ nāstitataḥ sukhaleśaḥ satyam | putrādapi dhanabhājāṁ bhītiḥ sarvatraiṣā vihitā rītiḥ ||",
    translation: "Reflect constantly that wealth is a source of calamity; there is no trace of true happiness from it. The wealthy fear even their own sons. This is the established way everywhere.",
    commentary: "Wealth (artha), often considered a legitimate goal of life, is here revealed as a source of trouble (anartha). True happiness doesn't come from riches - there's not even a trace (lesha) of real joy in mere accumulation. Paradoxically, wealthy people fear their own children, suspecting them of waiting for inheritance or plotting to seize wealth. This fear and suspicion poison relationships. The verse observes this as a universal pattern (vihita riti) - wherever wealth accumulates, anxiety follows. This isn't advocating poverty but warning against making wealth the center of life. Real wealth is contentment, devotion, and wisdom - assets no one can steal and which only grow when shared.",

    transliteration: "prāṇāyāmaṁ pratyāhāraṁ nityānityavivekavicāram | jāpyasametasamādhividhānaṁ kurvavadhānaṁ mahadavadhānam ||",
    translation: "Practice breath control, withdrawal of senses, discrimination between the eternal and non-eternal, meditation combined with mantra repetition - do this practice with great care and attention.",
    commentary: "This verse prescribes traditional yogic practices: (1) Pranayama - breath control techniques to still the mind and purify subtle energy channels; (2) Pratyahara - withdrawal of senses from external objects, turning awareness inward; (3) Nitya-anitya viveka - constant discrimination between what is permanent (Brahman) and what is impermanent (world); (4) Japa and Samadhi - mantra repetition leading to meditative absorption. The emphasis on 'great care' (mahad-avadhana) indicates these aren't mechanical practices but require full attention and sincerity. Together, these disciplines control the body, senses, and mind, preparing them for Self-realization. They form a complete sadhana combining physical, energetic, intellectual, and devotional approaches.",

    translation: "Be devoted to the lotus feet of the guru, and soon you will be liberated from worldly existence. Through control of the senses and mind, you will perceive the Divine dwelling in your own heart.",
    commentary: "The verse presents two key practices. First, complete devotion (bhakti) to the guru - not worship of the person, but reverence for the knowledge they embody. The guru is the guide who shows the path; surrender to their guidance accelerates liberation. Second, discipline of senses and mind (indriya-manasa-niyama) - controlling what we see, hear, think, and desire. When external distractions cease and internal chatter quiets, the Divine becomes perceptible in the heart (hridaya). This isn't the physical heart but the spiritual center of being. God is not in distant heaven but in the cave of your own heart - but only the still mind can perceive this. Devotion and discipline together remove the veils hiding this truth.",

    translation: "There was a foolish grammarian absorbed in the study of grammatical rules. O Shankaracharya, salutations to you! Be the boat for crossing the ocean of worldly existence.",
    commentary: "This verse circles back to the origin story - the old scholar lost in grammar while life passes. It concludes with a prayer to Shankaracharya himself, acknowledging him as the boat (nauka) that carries seekers across the ocean of samsara (worldly existence). The metaphor is powerful: samsara is a vast, turbulent ocean; we cannot swim across alone. The guru's teachings, embodied in texts like Bhaja Govindam, are the boat that safely transports us. This prayer reminds us that even studying spiritual texts is not the goal - liberation is. We study not to accumulate knowledge but to transform, to cross over from ignorance to enlightenment. Shankaracharya compassionately provides the means.",

    translation: "Worship Govinda, worship Govinda, worship Govinda, O fool! For crossing this worldly ocean, I see no other means than remembering the divine name.",
    commentary: "This verse, beginning the Dvadasha Panjarika section (12 supplementary verses), echoes the opening verse but adds emphasis: there is NO other way (nahi nahi) to cross the ocean of existence except nama-smarana - remembrance of God's name. This isn't mere repetition but points to bhakti (devotion) as a complete path. While jnana (knowledge) is the direct means, most people find pure inquiry difficult. Devotional chanting of divine names purifies the heart, concentrates the mind, and eventually leads to the same realization. The repetition 'bhaja Govindam' thrice creates urgency and emphasis. Time is short, intellectual pursuits won't save you - turn to God now, through the simple but powerful practice of remembering the Divine constantly.",

    commentary: "This verse, spoken from God's perspective, laments that people remain caught in worldly concerns while ignoring the Divine. Despite experiencing that family life brings endless obstacles and complications - difficult children, financial struggles, domestic problems - people don't turn to God. Diseases and sorrows visit regardless of our wishes, showing our lack of control, yet we don't seek the one source of peace and protection. The verse highlights human irrationality: we keep seeking happiness in the very places we've repeatedly found suffering, while ignoring the source of true joy. It's a call to wake up from this foolishness and redirect our love and attention to the Divine, who is the only reliable refuge.",

    translation: "With matted hair, or shaven head, or hair pulled out, wearing ochre robes in various fashions - even seeing all this, the fool does not see. These external displays are for the sake of filling the belly.",
    commentary: "A sharp critique of false renunciation and spiritual hypocrisy. People adopt external marks of spirituality - matted locks like ascetics, shaved heads like monks, ochre robes of sannyasis - but their motivation is worldly (udara-nimitta, for the belly - meaning livelihood, not liberation). They use spiritual appearance to gain respect, donations, and easy living. The 'fool' here is the gullible public who sees these external signs but doesn't see the truth behind them. True renunciation is internal - freedom from desires, attachments, and ego - not mere costume. The verse warns both impostors and their followers: don't mistake outer symbols for inner realization.

    translation: "The body has become decrepit, the head has turned grey, the mouth has become toothless. The old man walks with a stick, yet he does not abandon the bundle of desires.",
    commentary: "A vivid picture of old age: body deteriorated (galita), hair white (palita), head balding (munda), teeth lost (dashana-vihina), walking with a supporting stick (danda). Death is obviously near, the body clearly declaring its impermanence. Yet even in this condition, the 'bundle of desires' (asha-pinda) remains intact. The elderly person still schemes, desires, hopes for more - more years, more comforts, more achievements. This verse reveals the tragic grip of desire that persists until the very end. It's a wake-up call: don't wait until old age to renounce desires. Begin spiritual practice now, while the body and mind are strong. Let old age be a time of peace and wisdom, not regret over unfulfilled cravings.",

    sanskrit: "अग्रे वह्निः पृष्ठेभानुः रात्रौ चुबुकसमर्पितजानुः। करतलभिक्षस्तरुतलवासः तदपि न मुञ्चत्याशापाशः॥",
    transliteration: "agre vahniḥ pṛṣṭhebhānuḥ rātrau cubukasamarpitajānuḥ | karatala​bhikṣastarutalavāsaḥ tadapi na muñcatyāśāpāśaḥ ||",
    translation: "Fire in front, the sun at the back, at night huddled with chin resting on knees, begging for food with hands, living under a tree - yet still does not give up the noose of desires.",
    commentary: "This paints the life of an ascetic who has physically renounced everything - warming himself by fire, enduring harsh elements, sleeping rough under trees, begging for food. Yet despite this extreme outer renunciation, the inner 'noose of desires' (asha-pasha) still binds. The renunciate might desire recognition, spiritual attainments, heavenly rewards, or liberation itself as an acquisition. True renunciation isn't giving up possessions but giving up the desiring mind itself. You can live in a palace and be free, or in a forest and be bound - it depends on inner state, not outer circumstances. The verse warns against mistaking external austerity for spiritual achievement. Real freedom is freedom from wanting anything to be different than it is.",

    sanskrit: "कुरुते गङ्गासागरगमनं व्रतपरिपालनमथवा दानम्। ज्ञानविहीनः सर्वमतेन मुक्तिं न भजति जन्मशतेन॥",
    transliteration: "kurute gaṅgāsāgaragamanaṁ vrataparipālanamathavā dānam | jñānavihīnaḥ sarvamatena muktiṁ na bhajati janmaśatena ||",
    translation: "One may undertake pilgrimage to holy rivers and ocean, observe strict vows, or give great charity. But without knowledge, according to all schools of thought, one does not attain liberation even in a hundred lifetimes.",
    commentary: "This verse establishes the supremacy of knowledge (jnana) over all other practices. Pilgrimage to holy places like Ganga, observing religious vows (vrata), and giving charity (dana) are all commendable and purify the mind. However, without Self-knowledge, liberation (mukti) remains elusive - not in one lifetime, not in a hundred (janma-shatena). Why? Because these actions, while purifying and elevating, don't remove the fundamental ignorance about one's true nature. They may lead to better rebirths, heavenly rewards, or spiritual experiences, but not to final freedom. The phrase 'according to all schools' (sarva-matena) indicates this isn't just Advaitic teaching but universal spiritual wisdom. Knowledge alone liberates; practices prepare the ground for knowledge.",

    sanskrit: "सुरमन्दिरतरुमूलनिवासः शय्या भूतलमजिनं वासः। सर्वपरिग्रहभोगत्यागः कस्य सुखं न करोति विरागः॥",
    transliteration: "suramandirata​rumūlanivāsaḥ śayyā bhūtalamajināṁ vāsaḥ | sarvaparigraha​bhogatyāgaḥ kasya sukhaṁ na karoti virāgaḥ ||",
    translation: "Living in temples or under trees, sleeping on the ground, wearing deer skin, renouncing all possessions and enjoyments - for whom does dispassion not create happiness?",
    commentary: "This verse celebrates true vairagya (dispassion/renunciation). One who has genuinely renounced - living simply in temples or forests, sleeping on bare earth, wearing minimal clothing, having given up all acquisitions and pleasures - experiences sukha (happiness/peace). This isn't the forced asceticism of one suppressing desires, but the natural state of one who has seen through the emptiness of worldly pleasures. The rhetorical question 'for whom does this not create happiness?' implies it brings joy to anyone who practices it sincerely. True renunciation isn't deprivation but freedom. When you're free from the burden of possessions, the anxiety of protecting them, and the endless desires for more, what remains is natural contentment - the sukha that comes from inner freedom, not external circumstances.",

    sanskrit: "योगरतो वा भोगरतो वा सङ्गरतो वा सङ्गविहीनः। यस्य ब्रह्मणि रमते चित्तं नन्दति नन्दति नन्दत्येव॥",
    transliteration: "yogarato vā bhogarato vā saṅgarato vā saṅgavihīnaḥ | yasya brahmaṇi ramate cittaṁ nandati nandati nandatyeva ||",
    translation: "Whether attached to yoga, or attached to enjoyments, or attached to company, or detached from company - one whose mind delights in Brahman rejoices, rejoices, truly rejoices.",
    commentary: "This verse transcends dualities and externals. Whether someone is a yogi (dedicated to spiritual practice), a bhogi (enjoying worldly life), in company or in solitude - none of these external situations matter. What matters is the inner state: does the mind (chitta) delight (ramate) in Brahman? If yes, that person 'rejoices' (nandati) - the triple repetition emphasizing complete, genuine, constant joy. This joy isn't dependent on being a renunciate or householder, in activity or stillness, alone or with others. It's the intrinsic bliss of knowing one's true nature. This verse is liberating: you don't have to adopt a particular lifestyle to be free. Freedom is available in any circumstance when the mind rests in Brahman. External renunciation may help some, but inner realization is what truly matters.",

    transliteration: "bhagavadgītā kiñcidadhītā gaṅgājalalavakaṇikāpītā | sakṛdapi yena murārisamarcā kriyate tasya yamena na carcā ||",
    translation: "One who has studied even a little of the Bhagavad Gita, drunk even a drop of Ganga water, and worshipped Lord Murari (Krishna) even once - for such a person, there is no discussion with Yama (the lord of death).",
    commentary: "This verse offers comfort and encouragement. Even small spiritual efforts have great value. Studying even a portion of sacred texts like the Bhagavad Gita, partaking in holy water symbolizing purification, worshipping God even occasionally - these acts, done with faith, protect one from Yama (representing death and judgment). 'No discussion with Yama' means freedom from fear of death and rebirth. This shouldn't encourage laziness ('I've done a little, that's enough'), but rather inspire confidence that the spiritual path is forgiving and gracious. God doesn't demand perfection, just sincere effort. Even small steps toward the Divine are recognized and rewarded. This verse balances the earlier emphasis on knowledge by showing that devotion and practice, even in small measures, have protective power and spiritual value.",

    transliteration: "punarapi jananaṁ punarapi maraṇaṁ punarapi jananī jaṭhare śayanam | iha saṁsāre bahudustāre kṛpayā'pāre pāhi murāre ||",
    translation: "Again birth, again death, again lying in the mother's womb. This worldly existence is very difficult to cross. O Murari (Krishna), save me through Your boundless grace!",
    commentary: "One of the most moving verses in the text, expressing the weariness of endless samsara. The repetition 'punarapi' (again and again) emphasizes the exhausting cycle: birth, death, back to the womb, endless repetition. The phrase 'lying in the mother's womb' (janani-jathare shayanam) makes the cycle visceral and uncomfortable. Samsara is 'very difficult to cross' (bahu-dustara) - we can't escape through our own efforts alone. The verse concludes with a heartfelt cry for divine grace (kripa) to Lord Murari. This is bhakti at its purest - not demanding rights but humbly beseeching mercy. It acknowledges human limitation and divine compassion. While knowledge liberates, grace enables that knowledge to dawn. This prayer expresses the soul's deep longing for freedom from the wheel of birth and death.",

    transliteration: "rathyācarpaṭa​viracitakanthaḥ puṇyāpuṇyavivarjitapanthaḥ | yogī yoganiyojitacitto ramate bālonmattavadeva ||",
    translation: "Wearing a garment made of rags collected from the street, on a path beyond merit and sin, the yogi with mind absorbed in yoga rejoices like a child or like a madman.",
    commentary: "This describes the state of a realized yogi who has transcended worldly norms. Dressed in rags (showing complete indifference to appearance), having gone beyond the duality of punya-papa (merit and sin - seeing all as Brahman), with mind absorbed in yoga (unified with the Divine), such a person's behavior appears unconventional. They rejoice 'like a child or madman' (bala-unmatta-vat) - spontaneous, unselfconscious, free from social conditioning. A child plays without concern for opinions; a madman acts without ego-awareness. Similarly, the realized being, having transcended ego and convention, acts from spontaneous naturalness rather than calculation. This isn't license for irresponsible behavior but describes the freedom of one who has gone beyond all dualities. Their joy is natural, uncaused, flowing from being established in truth.",

    translation: "Who are you? Who am I? From where have I come? Who is my mother? Who is my father? Thus reflecting, regard all this as essenceless, and giving up the world as a dream, cease this dream-like deliberation.",
    commentary: "The concluding verse brings us full circle to fundamental inquiry. Ask yourself: Who are you really? Who am I beyond this name and form? Where did I come from before birth? Who are these people we call mother and father in the ultimate sense? These aren't rhetorical questions but tools for self-inquiry (atma-vichara). When deeply contemplated, they reveal that all relationships and identities are temporary roles in the dream of existence. Recognizing this entire universe as essenceless (asara - without substance) and dream-like (svapna), one should abandon even the mental deliberation about the dream. When you wake from a dream, you don't analyze the dream characters; you simply recognize 'it was just a dream.' Similarly, realize this world is a cosmic dream in consciousness, and rest in the truth of pure awareness - the dreamer, not the dream. This is liberation.",
