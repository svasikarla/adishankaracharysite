    sanskrit: "भज गोविन्दं भज गोविन्दं गोविन्दं भज मूढमते। संप्राप्ते सन्निहिते काले नहि नहि रक्षति डुकृञ्करणे॥",
    transliteration: "bhaja govindam bhaja govindam govindam bhaja mūḍhamate | samprāpte sannihite kāle nahi nahi rakṣati ḍukṛñkaraṇe ||",
    translation: "Worship Govinda, worship Govinda, worship Govinda, O fool! Rules of grammar will not save you at the time of your death.",
    commentary: "This opening verse sets the tone for the entire work. Shankaracharya urges us to seek the Divine rather than getting lost in mere intellectual pursuits. The word 'mūḍhamate' (O fool) is used compassionately, addressing those who mistake intellectual knowledge for spiritual wisdom. At death, grammatical expertise ('ḍukṛñkaraṇe' - grammatical rules) will be of no use; only devotion to God (Govinda) will help.",

    sanskrit: "मूढ जहीहि धनागमतृष्णां कुरु सद्बुद्धिं मनसि वितृष्णाम्। यल्लभसे निजकर्मोपात्तं वित्तं तेन विनोदय चित्तम्॥",
    transliteration: "mūḍha jahīhi dhanāgatṛṣṇāṁ kuru sadbuddhiṁ manasi vitṛṣṇām | yallabhase nijakarmo​pāttaṁ vittaṁ tena vinodaya cittam ||",
    translation: "O fool! Give up your thirst for wealth. Create in your mind, devoid of passions, thoughts of reality. What you get, be content with that. Let that make you happy.",
    commentary: "Shankaracharya teaches contentment and warns against endless material desires. The pursuit of wealth is insatiable - the more one has, the more one wants. True happiness comes from being content with what comes to us through our karma (past actions). 'Sadbuddhi' means right understanding - the discrimination between the eternal and the transient.",

    sanskrit: "नारीस्तनभर नाभीदेशं दृष्ट्वा मागा मोहावेशम्। एतन्मांसवसादिविकारं मनसि विचिन्तय वारं वारम्॥",
    transliteration: "nārīstanabhara nābhīdeśaṁ dṛṣṭvā māgā mohāveśam | etanmāṁsavasādivikāraṁ manasi vicintaya vāraṁ vāram ||",
    translation: "Looking at the female form with its fullness and navel, do not fall prey to delusion. Contemplate again and again in your mind that this is but a modification of flesh and fat.",
    commentary: "This verse addresses the power of sensory attractions and bodily desires. Shankaracharya asks us to see beyond superficial physical beauty and recognize the temporary nature of the body. This is not about disrespecting the female form but about understanding the transient nature of all physical manifestations. The practice of viveka (discrimination) helps us see the eternal essence beyond the temporary form.",

    sanskrit: "नलिनीदलगत जलमतितरलं तद्वज्जीवितमतिशयचपलम्। विद्धि व्याध्यभिमानग्रस्तं लोकं शोकहतं च समस्तम्॥",
    transliteration: "nalinīdalagata jalamatitaralaṁ tadvajjīvitamatiśayacapalam | viddhi vyādhyabhimāna​grastaṁ lokaṁ śokahataṁ ca samastam ||",
    translation: "The life of a person is as uncertain as rain drops trembling on a lotus leaf. Know that the whole world is devoured by disease and conceit and is riddled with pangs.",
    commentary: "This beautiful metaphor compares life to water droplets on a lotus leaf - beautiful but extremely fragile and temporary. The verse reminds us of life's uncertainty and the universal nature of suffering (disease and sorrow). Pride and ego ('abhimāna') only add to our suffering. Understanding this impermanence should motivate us toward spiritual seeking.",

    sanskrit: "यावद्वित्तोपार्जन सक्तः तावन्निज परिवारो रक्तः। पश्चाज्जीवति जर्जर देहे वार्तां कोऽपि न पृच्छति गेहे॥",
    transliteration: "yāvadvittopārjana saktaḥ tāvannija parivāro raktaḥ | paścājjīvati jarjara dehe vārtāṁ ko'pi na pṛcchati gehe ||",
    translation: "As long as there is the ability to earn and save, so long all your family members are attached to you. Later, when you come to live with an old, infirm body, no one at home cares to speak even a word with you.",
    commentary: "A stark reminder of the conditional nature of worldly relationships. People are often attached not to us but to what we can provide. In old age, when earning capacity ceases, even family members may become indifferent. This is not to create cynicism but to inspire us to seek relationships based on eternal values and ultimately to seek the unchanging Divine, whose love is unconditional.",

    sanskrit: "यावत्पवनो निवसति देहे तावत्पृच्छति कुशलं गेहे। गतवति वायौ देहापाये भार्या बिभ्यति तस्मिन्काये॥",
    transliteration: "yāvatpavano nivasati dehe tāvatpṛcchati kuśalaṁ gehe | gatavati vāyau dehāpāye bhāryā bibhyati tasminkāye ||",
    translation: "As long as there is breath in the body, people at home enquire about one's welfare. Once the breath (life) leaves, even the wife fears that very same body.",
    commentary: "This verse powerfully illustrates the impermanence of the body and the transitory nature of attachment. The same body that was cherished becomes an object of fear when life departs. This teaches us that we are not the body - we are the eternal consciousness that temporarily inhabits it. Family attachment is to the living person, not to the mere physical form.",

    sanskrit: "बालस्तावत्क्रीडासक्तः तरुणस्तावत्तरुणीसक्तः। वृद्धस्तावच्चिन्तासक्तः परे ब्रह्मणि कोऽपि न सक्तः॥",
    transliteration: "bālastāvatkrīḍāsaktaḥ taruṇastāvattaruṇīsaktaḥ | vṛddhastāvaccintāsaktaḥ pare brahmaṇi ko'pi na saktaḥ ||",
    translation: "Childhood is spent in play, youth in dalliance with the opposite sex, old age passes with anxiety and fear. But hardly anyone is interested in the contemplation of the Supreme Brahman.",
    commentary: "A poignant commentary on how human life is wasted in various distractions at different stages. Children play, youth indulge in sensual pleasures, and old people worry about their fading life - but few turn their attention to the eternal Truth. This verse urges us not to postpone spiritual seeking, as each life stage brings its own distractions.",

    sanskrit: "का ते कान्ता धनगतचिन्ता वातुल किं तव नास्ति नियन्ता। त्रिजगति सज्जनसं गतिरैका भवति भवार्णवतरणे नौका॥",
    transliteration: "kā te kāntā dhanagata​cintā vātula kiṁ tava nāsti niyantā | trijagati sajjanasamgatiraikā bhavati bhavārṇava​taraṇe naukā ||",
    translation: "O mad man! Why this anxiety about wife and wealth? Is there not a controller of your life? In the three worlds, it is only the association with the good that can serve as a boat to cross the sea of life.",
    commentary: "Shankaracharya questions our excessive worries about family and wealth. There is a Divine controller (God) who manages everything according to karma. Instead of constant anxiety, we should seek the company of saints and sages ('sajjana-sangati'). Good company is described as the boat that helps us cross the ocean of worldly existence (samsara).",
