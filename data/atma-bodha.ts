    sanskrit: "तपोभिः क्षीणपापानां शान्तानां वीतरागिणाम्। मुमुक्षूणामपेक्ष्योऽयमात्मबोधो विधीयते॥",
    transliteration: "tapobhiḥ kṣīṇapāpānāṁ śāntānāṁ vītarāgiṇām | mumukṣūṇāmapekṣyo'yamātmabodho vidhīyate ||",
    translation: "This Atma Bodha (Self-Knowledge) is being composed for those whose sins have been destroyed by austerities, who are calm, free from attachment, and are desirous of liberation.",
    commentary: "Shankaracharya opens by defining the qualifications needed to study this profound text. The seeker must have: 1) purified the mind through spiritual practices (tapas), 2) achieved mental peace and tranquility, 3) reduced attachments to worldly objects, and 4) possess a genuine desire for liberation (mumukshutva). These qualifications ensure the teachings will be properly understood and applied."

    sanskrit: "बोधोऽन्यसाधनेभ्यो हि साक्षान्मोक्षैकसाधनम्। पाकस्य वह्निवज्ज्ञानं विना मोक्षो न सिध्यति॥",
    transliteration: "bodho'nyasādhanebhyo hi sākṣānmokṣaikasādhanam | pākasya vahnivajjñānaṁ vinā mokṣo na sidhyati ||",
    translation: "Knowledge alone is the direct means to liberation, unlike other means. As cooking is impossible without fire, so is liberation impossible without Self-knowledge.",
    commentary: "This verse establishes the supremacy of knowledge (jnana) in the path to moksha. While rituals, meditation, and devotion purify the mind and prepare it, only direct knowledge of the Self liberates. The metaphor is powerful: just as no amount of other activities can substitute for fire in cooking, no other practice can replace Self-knowledge for attaining liberation."

    sanskrit: "अविरोधितया कर्म नाज्ञानं विनिवर्तयेत्। विद्याऽविद्यां निहन्त्येव तेजस्तिमिरसङ्घवत्॥",
    transliteration: "avirodhitayā karma nājñānaṁ vinivartayet | vidyā'vidyāṁ nihantyeva tejastimirasaṅghavat ||",
    translation: "Action cannot destroy ignorance, for they are not opposed to each other. Knowledge alone destroys ignorance, as light destroys dense darkness.",
    commentary: "Actions (karma) and ignorance (avidya) operate in different domains. Performing actions - even good actions - cannot remove the fundamental ignorance about our true nature. Only knowledge (vidya) can remove ignorance, just as only light can remove darkness. This doesn't mean actions are useless - they purify the mind and make it fit for receiving knowledge."

    sanskrit: "परिच्छिन्नमिवाज्ञानात्स्वात्मनः परिकल्पितम्। तद्विनाशे तु तत्किन्चिन्नाहमस्मीति भासते॥",
    transliteration: "paricchinnamivājñānātsvātmanaḥ parikalpitam | tadvināśe tu tatkincinnnāhamasmīti bhāsate ||",
    translation: "Due to ignorance, the Self, though non-limited, appears limited. When ignorance is destroyed, the Self shines by itself, like the sun after clouds disperse.",
    commentary: "Our true nature is unlimited, infinite consciousness. However, ignorance makes us identify with the limited body-mind complex. When this ignorance is removed through knowledge, the Self is not created or changed - it simply stands revealed, like the sun that was always shining but hidden by clouds."

    sanskrit: "अज्ञानकलुषं जीवं ज्ञानाभ्यासाद्विनिर्मलम्। कृत्वा ज्ञानं स्वयं नश्येत् जलं कतकरेणुवत्॥",
    transliteration: "ajñānakaluṣaṁ jīvaṁ jñānābhyāsādvinirmalam | kṛtvā jñānaṁ svayaṁ naśyet jalaṁ katakarēṇuvat ||",
    translation: "Having purified the individual soul, tainted by ignorance, through constant practice of knowledge, knowledge itself disappears, like the powder of the clearing-nut after purifying water.",
    commentary: "This beautiful analogy explains how knowledge works. The clearing-nut (kataka) powder is used to purify muddy water - it binds with impurities and settles down, leaving clear water. Similarly, the knowledge 'I am not the body-mind, I am pure consciousness' removes ignorance. Once ignorance is gone, even the knowledge used to remove it merges into pure awareness, leaving only the Self."

    sanskrit: "संसारः स्वप्नतुल्यः स्यात् स्वप्नेन च यथा न तथा। निद्राविलयमात्रेण पुनरागमनं भवेत्॥",
    transliteration: "saṁsāraḥ svapnatulyaḥ syāt svapnena ca yathā na tathā | nidrāvilayamātreṇa punarāgamanaṁ bhavet ||",
    translation: "The world is like a dream. As in a dream, it appears real during the dream but becomes false on waking, similarly this world appears real in ignorance but unreal in knowledge.",
    commentary: "Shankaracharya uses the dream analogy extensively. While dreaming, the dream world seems completely real - we experience emotions, relationships, and events. But on waking, we realize it was all a mental projection. Similarly, the waking world, experienced through the body-mind, appears real due to ignorance but is recognized as a superimposition on consciousness when we awaken to Self-knowledge."

    sanskrit: "जन्मादिमत्फलगं सत्यानृतमिति द्विधा भवति। सत्यानन्दमनन्तं ब्रह्मत्तद्धि परमार्थतः॥",
    transliteration: "janmādimatphalgaṁ satyānṛtamiti dvidhā bhavati | satyānandamanantaṁ brahma​ttaddhi paramārthataḥ ||",
    translation: "Everything that has birth and death, that which has a beginning, middle and end, is divided into real and unreal. Brahman alone is real - it is existence, consciousness, and bliss, infinite and eternal.",
    commentary: "This verse establishes the fundamental Advaita distinction: what is temporary and subject to change is ultimately unreal (mithya), while only the eternal, unchanging Brahman is real (satya). Brahman is described with three attributes: Sat (existence/truth), Chit (consciousness), and Ananda (bliss), and is infinite in nature."

    number: 8,
    sanskrit: "द्वयोः संश्लेषतः कार्यं विवेकः शोभते सदा। स्वर्णसर्पयोरिव विवेकः परमात्मनि॥",
    transliteration: "dvayoḥ saṁśleṣataḥ kāryaṁ vivekaḥ śobhate sadā | svarṇasarpayoriva vivekaḥ paramātmani ||",
    translation: "Discrimination between the Self and the non-Self must always be practiced, just as discrimination between a rope and a snake, or between gold and ornament.",
    commentary: "Viveka (discrimination) is the key practice in Advaita Vedanta. We must learn to distinguish between the eternal Self (Atman) and the temporary non-self (body, mind, world). The classic example: seeing a rope in dim light, we mistake it for a snake - the rope is real, the snake is a misperception. Similarly, we mistake the body-mind for our Self. Constant discrimination reveals the truth."
