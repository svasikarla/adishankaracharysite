    transliteration: "tapobhiḥ kṣīṇapāpānāṁ śāntānāṁ vītarāgiṇām | mumukṣūṇāmapekṣyo'yamātmabodho vidhīyate ||",
    translation: "This Atma Bodha (Self-Knowledge) is being composed for those whose sins have been destroyed by austerities, who are calm, free from attachment, and are desirous of liberation.",
    commentary: "Shankaracharya opens by defining the qualifications needed to study this profound text. The seeker must have: 1) purified the mind through spiritual practices (tapas), 2) achieved mental peace and tranquility, 3) reduced attachments to worldly objects, and 4) possess a genuine desire for liberation (mumukshutva). These qualifications ensure the teachings will be properly understood and applied."

    sanskrit: "बोधोऽन्यसाधनेभ्यो हि साक्षान्मोक्षैकसाधनम्। पाकस्य वह्निवज्ज्ञानं विना मोक्षो न सिध्यति॥",
    transliteration: "bodho'nyasādhanebhyo hi sākṣānmokṣaikasādhanam | pākasya vahnivajjñānaṁ vinā mokṣo na sidhyati ||",
    translation: "Knowledge alone is the direct means to liberation, unlike other means. As cooking is impossible without fire, so is liberation impossible without Self-knowledge.",
    commentary: "This verse establishes the supremacy of knowledge (jnana) in the path to moksha. While rituals, meditation, and devotion purify the mind and prepare it, only direct knowledge of the Self liberates. The metaphor is powerful: just as no amount of other activities can substitute for fire in cooking, no other practice can replace Self-knowledge for attaining liberation."

    sanskrit: "अविरोधितया कर्म नाज्ञानं विनिवर्तयेत्। विद्याऽविद्यां निहन्त्येव तेजस्तिमिरसङ्घवत्॥",
    transliteration: "avirodhitayā karma nājñānaṁ vinivartayet | vidyā'vidyāṁ nihantyeva tejastimirasaṅghavat ||",
    translation: "Action cannot destroy ignorance, for they are not opposed to each other. Knowledge alone destroys ignorance, as light destroys dense darkness.",
    commentary: "Actions (karma) and ignorance (avidya) operate in different domains. Performing actions - even good actions - cannot remove the fundamental ignorance about our true nature. Only knowledge (vidya) can remove ignorance, just as only light can remove darkness. This doesn't mean actions are useless - they purify the mind and make it fit for receiving knowledge."

    transliteration: "paricchinnamivājñānātsvātmanaḥ parikalpitam | tadvināśe tu tatkincinnnāhamasmīti bhāsate ||",
    translation: "Due to ignorance, the Self, though non-limited, appears limited. When ignorance is destroyed, the Self shines by itself, like the sun after clouds disperse.",
    commentary: "Our true nature is unlimited, infinite consciousness. However, ignorance makes us identify with the limited body-mind complex. When this ignorance is removed through knowledge, the Self is not created or changed - it simply stands revealed, like the sun that was always shining but hidden by clouds."

    transliteration: "ajñānakaluṣaṁ jīvaṁ jñānābhyāsādvinirmalam | kṛtvā jñānaṁ svayaṁ naśyet jalaṁ katakarēṇuvat ||",
    translation: "Having purified the individual soul, tainted by ignorance, through constant practice of knowledge, knowledge itself disappears, like the powder of the clearing-nut after purifying water.",
    commentary: "This beautiful analogy explains how knowledge works. The clearing-nut (kataka) powder is used to purify muddy water - it binds with impurities and settles down, leaving clear water. Similarly, the knowledge 'I am not the body-mind, I am pure consciousness' removes ignorance. Once ignorance is gone, even the knowledge used to remove it merges into pure awareness, leaving only the Self."

    transliteration: "saṁsāraḥ svapnatulyaḥ syāt svapnena ca yathā na tathā | nidrāvilayamātreṇa punarāgamanaṁ bhavet ||",
    translation: "The world is like a dream. As in a dream, it appears real during the dream but becomes false on waking, similarly this world appears real in ignorance but unreal in knowledge.",
    commentary: "Shankaracharya uses the dream analogy extensively. While dreaming, the dream world seems completely real - we experience emotions, relationships, and events. But on waking, we realize it was all a mental projection. Similarly, the waking world, experienced through the body-mind, appears real due to ignorance but is recognized as a superimposition on consciousness when we awaken to Self-knowledge."

    translation: "Everything that has birth and death, that which has a beginning, middle and end, is divided into real and unreal. Brahman alone is real - it is existence, consciousness, and bliss, infinite and eternal.",
    commentary: "This verse establishes the fundamental Advaita distinction: what is temporary and subject to change is ultimately unreal (mithya), while only the eternal, unchanging Brahman is real (satya). Brahman is described with three attributes: Sat (existence/truth), Chit (consciousness), and Ananda (bliss), and is infinite in nature."

    transliteration: "dvayoḥ saṁśleṣataḥ kāryaṁ vivekaḥ śobhate sadā | svarṇasarpayoriva vivekaḥ paramātmani ||",
    translation: "Discrimination between the Self and the non-Self must always be practiced, just as discrimination between a rope and a snake, or between gold and ornament.",
    commentary: "Viveka (discrimination) is the key practice in Advaita Vedanta. We must learn to distinguish between the eternal Self (Atman) and the temporary non-self (body, mind, world). The classic example: seeing a rope in dim light, we mistake it for a snake - the rope is real, the snake is a misperception. Similarly, we mistake the body-mind for our Self. Constant discrimination reveals the truth."

    translation: "The Self is Truth, eternal Bliss, pure Consciousness. Due to lack of discrimination, all this (the world) appears in it like a dream.",
    commentary: "This verse describes the true nature of the Self (Atman). It is absolute truth (satya), eternal bliss (ananda), self-luminous consciousness (prakasha), and pure (shuddha). The entire phenomenal world appears in this consciousness like a dream appears in the mind of a dreamer. The world seems real only due to lack of discrimination (aviveka)."

    transliteration: "dehe prāṇe manasyātmā hyajānanmanute jaḍaḥ | tanmalādātmavidyāstu tattadbhāvāddhi sarvadā ||",
    translation: "Through ignorance, one thinks 'I am the body', 'I am the vital force', 'I am the mind'. These impurities are removed by Self-knowledge, which reveals the true nature always.",
    commentary: "This verse identifies the fundamental error - misidentification with the body, vital energy (prana), or mind. These are all objects of consciousness, not consciousness itself. The Self is the witness of all these, never the doer or experiencer. Self-knowledge removes this impurity of wrong identification and reveals the ever-present true nature of the Self."

    translation: "The Self is the eternal witness of the intellect and sense organs. The delusion about the Self is like the superimposition of a snake on a rope.",
    commentary: "The Self is the unchanging witness (sakshi) that observes the intellect, senses, and all activities. It is never involved in any action or experience. The mistake of identifying the Self with the body-mind is compared to seeing a rope in dim light and mistaking it for a snake - the rope (Self) is real and never changes, while the snake (body-mind identification) is a false superimposition."

    translation: "The truth of the Self should be discovered by discriminating it from the five sheaths, through the method of 'not this, not this' (neti neti).",
    commentary: "The Self is covered by five sheaths (koshas): physical, vital, mental, intellectual, and bliss sheath. To realize the Self, we must discriminate and negate each sheath through the method of neti neti (not this, not this). By rejecting everything that is an object of consciousness, what remains is the eternal subject - pure Consciousness itself."

    translation: "This physical body, made of food essence and the five gross elements, is called the gross body or the food sheath (annamaya kosha).",
    commentary: "The first sheath is the physical body (annamaya kosha), composed of food and the five gross elements (earth, water, fire, air, space). This is the most apparent covering of the Self. It has birth and death, and is subject to decay and disease. The Self, being the witness of this body, is not affected by its changes."

    transliteration: "prāṇādipañcavāyavaḥ vākpāṇipādapāyavaḥ | karmendriyāṇi pañca syuḥ prāṇamayakośakaḥ ||",
    translation: "The five vital airs (pranas) along with the five organs of action constitute the vital sheath (pranamaya kosha).",
    commentary: "The second sheath is the vital sheath, consisting of the five vital forces (prana, apana, vyana, udana, samana) and the five organs of action (speech, hands, feet, organs of excretion and reproduction). This sheath enlivens the physical body but is itself inert when separated from consciousness. The Self is distinct from this sheath as well."

    transliteration: "manaḥ saṁkalpavikalpādibhiḥ jñānendriyaiḥ saha | manomayaḥ parikhyātaḥ kartṛtvādisamanvitaḥ ||",
    translation: "The mind with its functions of doubt and determination, along with the five sense organs, is called the mental sheath (manomaya kosha), associated with the sense of doership.",
    commentary: "The third sheath is the mental sheath, consisting of the mind (manas) and the five sense organs (eyes, ears, nose, tongue, skin). The mind constantly wavers between thoughts, desires, and emotions. It creates the sense of 'I am the doer' (kartritva). However, the Self is the witness of the mind, not the mind itself. The Self remains untouched by mental modifications."

    transliteration: "buddhirjñānendriyaiḥ sārdhaṁ vijñānamayakośakaḥ | vicārakartā jīvasya saṁsārasya karaṇam ||",
    translation: "The intellect along with the sense organs forms the intellectual sheath (vijnanamaya kosha). It is the cause of the individual's bondage to the cycle of birth and death.",
    commentary: "The fourth sheath is the intellectual sheath, composed of the buddhi (intellect) and sense organs. This is the discriminating faculty that determines right from wrong, analyzes, and decides. When this buddhi identifies with the body-mind complex, it creates the sense of individual ego (jiva), which is the root cause of bondage and suffering in samsara."

    transliteration: "anādikālo'vidyāpi upādhiḥ śuddhasattvak aḥ | ānandamayakośaḥ syāt suṣuptau sphurati priyaḥ ||",
    translation: "The beginningless ignorance, made of pure sattva, is the bliss sheath (anandamaya kosha). It manifests clearly in deep sleep as the experience of happiness.",
    commentary: "The fifth and subtlest sheath is the bliss sheath, which is closest to the Self. This is experienced in deep sleep when all other sheaths are temporarily dormant, and we experience peace and bliss. However, this is still a sheath covering the Self, not the Self itself. The Self is the witness even of this bliss, and transcends all five koshas."

    transliteration: "pañcakośavilakṣaṇaḥ sansaccidānandarūpakaḥ | sarvadā sarvagaḥ śuddhaḥ sa ātmā tvamasītyalam ||",
    translation: "Distinct from the five sheaths, of the nature of Existence-Consciousness-Bliss, always all-pervading and pure - That Self is You. This is enough.",
    commentary: "After negating all five sheaths through discrimination, what remains is the true Self - pure Existence (Sat), Consciousness (Chit), and Bliss (Ananda). This Self is not limited by space or time, is eternally pure, and pervades everything. The great Vedantic declaration 'Tat Tvam Asi' (That Thou Art) points to this identity between the individual Self and the Supreme Self."

    transliteration: "sthūlābhāse paṭādau yathā tantustathātmani | vikāropādhayaḥ sarve teṣāṁ satyamidaṁ jagat ||",
    translation: "Just as thread is the reality in a cloth and various forms, so the Self is the reality in all modifications and limiting adjuncts. For them (the modifications), this world is real.",
    commentary: "This verse uses the analogy of thread and cloth. Just as all cloth products are essentially thread in different forms, all objects in the universe are essentially the Self appearing in various forms. The modifications (vikara) and limiting adjuncts (upadhi) are superimposed on the Self. From the relative standpoint, the world is real, but from the absolute standpoint, only the Self is real."

    transliteration: "śarīraṁ sādhanaṁ jñānasya jñānaṁ mukteḥ sādhanam | śarīrasya vināśo'pi na muktau bādhako bhavet ||",
    translation: "The body is the instrument for acquiring knowledge, and knowledge is the means to liberation. The destruction of the body is not an obstacle to liberation.",
    commentary: "This verse clarifies that while the human body is necessary as an instrument to acquire Self-knowledge through study and practice, knowledge itself is what brings liberation, not bodily death. Liberation is the realization of our eternal nature, which transcends the body. When one gains Self-knowledge while alive, the eventual death of the body doesn't affect the already-realized state of freedom."

    transliteration: "nāhaṁ deho na me deho bodho'haṁ bodharūpadhṛk | itthaṁ vivekataḥ paśyan brahmajñaḥ svaprakāśavān ||",
    translation: "I am not the body, nor is the body mine. I am knowledge itself, the very form of consciousness. Seeing thus through discrimination, the knower of Brahman becomes self-luminous.",
    commentary: "This is a key discriminative statement. Through viveka, one realizes: I am not the body, the body is not my possession - I am pure consciousness itself. When this realization stabilizes through constant contemplation, one becomes a knower of Brahman (brahmajnah). Such a person is self-luminous (svaprakasha), needing no external source for knowledge or happiness."

    transliteration: "ātmanaḥ śuddhabodhasya dehendriyaguṇakriyāḥ | āropitāḥ paṭatantunyāyena rajjusarpavat ||",
    translation: "The qualities and activities of the body and senses are superimposed on the Self, which is pure consciousness, like the rope appearing as a snake or thread appearing as cloth.",
    commentary: "The Self is pure, actionless consciousness. All the qualities (gunas) and activities (kriyas) belong to the body-mind complex, not to the Self. Yet through ignorance, we superimpose these on the Self, thinking 'I am fat', 'I am happy', 'I am doing this'. This is a false superimposition (adhyasa), like seeing a snake where there is only a rope, or seeing cloth and forgetting the underlying thread."

    transliteration: "ātmano vikriyāṁ nityaṁ paśyatyajño'pyahaṁ dhruvaḥ | rajjuṁ sarpaṁ ca paśyannapi rajjureva satyam ||",
    translation: "The ignorant person constantly sees change in the changeless Self, thinking 'I am the doer'. Just as one seeing a snake in a rope doesn't change the rope - the rope alone is real.",
    commentary: "The ignorant person constantly attributes change, action, and modification to the Self, thinking 'I am aging', 'I am becoming happy or sad', 'I am the doer of actions'. But just as mistaking a rope for a snake doesn't change the rope in any way, our misperception doesn't change the Self. The Self remains eternally changeless (dhruva) and untouched by any modifications."

    translation: "Just as the sun appears to be covered by clouds and fog due to darkness, similarly the Self appears to be limited by the body due to ignorance.",
    commentary: "The sun is self-luminous and is never actually covered by clouds - the clouds only appear to obstruct our vision of the sun. Similarly, the Self is self-effulgent consciousness that cannot actually be covered or limited by anything. It only appears to be limited by the body due to ignorance (ajnana). When ignorance is removed, the Self is seen to be eternally free and unlimited."

    translation: "The Self is distinct from the three bodies, the eternal witness, pure consciousness. Though I exist in all three bodies, these bodies don't exist in Me.",
    commentary: "The Self is different from the three bodies - gross (physical), subtle (mind-intellect), and causal (ignorance). It is the witness (sakshi) of all three, being pure consciousness itself. Though the Self illumines and pervades all three bodies (like space pervading pots), the bodies don't affect or limit the Self, just as pots don't limit space. This is the asymmetrical relationship between consciousness and its objects."

    translation: "Existence, consciousness, bliss, name, and form - these are the five constituents. The first three belong to Brahman; name and form constitute the world.",
    commentary: "Every object in the universe can be analyzed into five aspects: Existence (asti), Consciousness/appearance (bhati), Bliss/desirability (priya), Name (nama), and Form (rupa). The first three - existence, consciousness, and bliss - belong to Brahman, the ultimate reality. Name and form are the superimposition that creates the apparent world. When we separate the name-form from an object, what remains is Brahman alone."

    translation: "Name and form are perishable, but the Self is of the nature of eternal truth. Just as the name and form 'pot' are temporary, but clay (its substance) is real and enduring.",
    commentary: "This verse uses the classic clay-pot analogy. A pot is named and shaped from clay, but the name 'pot' and the form of the pot are temporary and will perish. However, clay - the substance - is real and persists. Similarly, all names and forms in the universe are temporary modifications of Brahman, while Brahman itself is the eternal, unchanging reality that underlies all appearances."

    translation: "Everything appears through the quality of sattva (purity). The witness doesn't appear - this is only a notion. Sattva appears through consciousness; to say consciousness appears through sattva is illogical.",
    commentary: "Objects appear in consciousness when the mind is purified (sattvic). However, consciousness (the witness) doesn't 'appear' - it is self-luminous and eternal. It's illogical to say consciousness appears through sattva, because sattva itself is illumined by consciousness. The witness-consciousness is the ultimate subject that can never become an object. All objects appear in it, but it doesn't appear in anything."

    commentary: "When discrimination removes all false identifications, what remains is the direct realization: 'I am Brahman' (Aham Brahmasmi). This is one of the four great Vedantic statements (Mahavakyas). The realized person knows directly: I am pure Existence-Consciousness (Sat-Chit), I am ever auspicious and free (Shiva). This is not intellectual knowledge but direct, experiential realization that destroys ignorance forever."

    commentary: "This profound verse presents the absolute truth from the highest perspective. From the viewpoint of the Self, there is no creation or dissolution of the universe, no bondage or spiritual practice, no seeker or liberation - because the Self is eternally free and complete. All these concepts exist only in the realm of relative reality. This is known as the ajata vada (doctrine of non-origination) - the highest teaching that nothing has ever been created, and the Self alone exists."

    translation: "Due to delusion, one sees duality; through knowledge, one perceives the oneness in the Self. Ignorance is the cause of bondage; knowledge alone grants liberation.",
    commentary: "This verse explains the fundamental cause of bondage and liberation. When the mind is deluded (moha), we perceive duality - the separation between subject and object, self and others. This perception of multiplicity is the root of all suffering. However, when knowledge of the Self dawns, we recognize the fundamental oneness of all existence. Ignorance (ajnana) creates bondage by making us identify with the limited body-mind, while Self-knowledge (jnana) reveals our true unlimited nature and grants liberation."

This is not mere intellectual understanding but direct realization. When this supreme knowledge stabilizes, the seeker (yati) attains complete liberation (nirvana), which is freedom from all suffering, the end of the cycle of birth and death, and the realization of infinite peace and bliss."

But the snake never existed; it was always just a rope. Similarly, samsara (worldly existence with all its joys and sorrows, births and deaths) appears very real to us, but from the standpoint of ultimate truth (tattva), it is false (mithya).

This mental purity leads to smriti - remembrance or recognition of our true nature. This is not ordinary memory but direct recognition of the Self.

Ignorance (ajnana) appears as delusion (bhranti) that hides the true nature of reality (tattva).

In contrast, the seer - pure consciousness, Brahman - is true existence (satya), non-dual (advaita), consciousness itself (chaitanya), and beyond all qualities (nirguna).

No. Am I the mind? No. Am I the emotions? No. Through this process of negation (neti neti), what remains is the pure witness consciousness - the Self.

    sanskrit: "यथा दीपो निरायासाद्यथा दीपं प्रकाशयेत्। तथा ब्रह्म निरायासं स्वयमेवात्मना विभाति॥",
    transliteration: "yathā dīpo nirāyāsādyathā dīpaṁ prakāśayet | tathā brahma nirāyāsaṁ svayamevātmanā vibhāti ||",
    translation: "Just as a lamp illuminates without effort, so does Brahman shine by its own nature, effortlessly.",
    commentary: "This beautiful analogy compares Brahman to a lamp. A lamp doesn't try to give light - luminosity is its very nature. Similarly, Brahman doesn't make an effort to be conscious or to illumine objects - consciousness is its very nature (svabhava). The Self is self-luminous (svayam-prakasha), requiring no external source to know itself. Just as a lamp reveals both itself and other objects simultaneously, consciousness reveals both itself and all objects of knowledge. Understanding this effortless, natural luminosity of awareness helps us recognize that being conscious is what we already are, not what we need to become."

    sanskrit: "न निरोधो न चोत्पत्तिः न बद्धो न च साधकः। न मुमुक्षुर्न वै मुक्त इत्येषा परमार्थता॥",
    transliteration: "na nirodho na cotpattiḥ na baddho na ca sādhakaḥ | na mumukṣurna vai mukta ityeṣā paramārthatā ||",
    translation: "There is no dissolution, no creation, no bondage, no seeker, no aspirant for liberation, and no liberated one. This is the ultimate truth.",
    commentary: "This verse presents the absolute truth (paramartha) from the highest perspective - the standpoint of pure Brahman. From this viewpoint, nothing has ever been created or dissolved, no one has ever been bound or seeking liberation, and no one has ever been liberated. All these concepts apply only to the realm of apparent reality (vyavaharika). From the absolute standpoint, only Brahman exists - eternally free, complete, and unchanged. This teaching, known as ajata vada (doctrine of non-origination), is the culmination of Advaita philosophy. It doesn't negate the practical reality of spiritual practice but points to the ultimate truth that transcends all concepts."

    sanskrit: "जीवन्मुक्तस्य या स्थितिः सा देहान्ते च केवला। ब्रह्मण्येव लयं याति सलिलं सलिले यथा॥",
    transliteration: "jīvanmuktasya yā sthitiḥ sā dehānte ca kevalā | brahmaṇyeva layaṁ yāti salilaṁ salile yathā ||",
    translation: "The state of one who is liberated while living becomes absolute after the fall of the body. One merges in Brahman as water merges in water.",
    commentary: "This verse describes jivanmukti (liberation while living) and videha-mukti (bodiless liberation). The jivanmukta - one who knows the Self while still embodied - remains as pure consciousness even while the body-mind continues. When the body falls away (death), this state doesn't change qualitatively but becomes 'kevala' (absolute) - there's no longer even the appearance of a body. The merger is compared to water mixing with water - there's no real merger because separation never existed. The drop was always the ocean; only the illusion of separateness is removed. This is the final freedom."

    sanskrit: "ब्रह्मज्ञानं यदा जाते भवेत् तत्क्षणमेव तु। स जीवन्मुक्त इत्युक्तः देहे तिष्ठन्नपि स्वयम्॥",
    transliteration: "brahmajñānaṁ yadā jāte bhavet tatkṣaṇameva tu | sa jīvanmukta ityuktaḥ dehe tiṣṭhannapi svayam ||",
    translation: "The moment knowledge of Brahman arises, at that very instant, one is called liberated while living (jivanmukta), even though dwelling in the body.",
    commentary: "Liberation is immediate upon Self-knowledge - not after death, not after years of practice, but instantly (tatkshana). The jivanmukta is free while still embodied because bondage was never real - it was only ignorance of one's true nature. The body continues due to prarabdha karma (past karma that has already begun to fructify), but the wise person no longer identifies with it. Like the potter's wheel that keeps spinning even after the potter has stopped, the body continues its functions, but the realized person knows 'I am not the body, I am Brahman.' This is living freedom."

    transliteration: "prārabdhaṁ puṣyate yāvat tāvajjīvo hi tiṣṭhati | prārabdhaṁ tu kṣayaṁ yāti tadā kaivalyamaśnute ||",
    translation: "As long as prarabdha karma continues, the jivanmukta appears to live. When prarabdha is exhausted, one attains absolute liberation (kaivalya).",
    commentary: "This explains why the liberated sage's body continues. Prarabdha karma - the portion of past karma that has already begun to manifest - must run its course, like an arrow already shot from a bow. While sanchita karma (accumulated) and agami karma (future) are destroyed by knowledge, prarabdha continues until the body falls. However, the jnani is not affected by this. To an observer, the sage appears to experience pleasure and pain, but inwardly, there's complete freedom. When prarabdha is exhausted, the body falls away, and absolute oneness (kaivalya) with Brahman is evident even externally."

    transliteration: "deho'haṁ jīva ityevaṁ yāvadasti manogatam | tāvatpuṇyaphalaṁ bhuktvā punarāyāti mānavaḥ ||",
    translation: "As long as the thought 'I am the body, I am an individual' persists in the mind, one enjoys the fruits of good karma and returns again (to rebirth).",
    commentary: "This verse warns about the cycle of rebirth (samsara). As long as one identifies with the body-mind complex - thinking 'I am this body, I am John/Mary, I am the doer and experiencer' - the cycle continues. Even doing good deeds (punya) doesn't liberate; it only leads to enjoyment of pleasant experiences in this life or heaven in the next, followed by inevitable return to earthly existence. Only Self-knowledge breaks this cycle. The identification 'I am the body' (deha-adhyasa) is the root of all bondage. When this false identification is removed through knowledge, the cycle ends."

    transliteration: "yadā na līyate cittaṁ na ca vikṣipyate punaḥ | aniṅganamānābhāsaṁ tadā tatparamaṁ padam ||",
    translation: "When the mind neither sinks into dullness nor gets distracted outward, when it is motionless without mental modification, then that is the supreme state.",
    commentary: "This describes the state of realized consciousness. The mind of the jnani neither falls into tamas (dullness, sleep, unconsciousness) nor gets scattered into rajas (distraction, desires, thoughts). It remains in perfect equilibrium - not blank or unconscious, but radiantly aware without content. This is called 'nirvikalpa' (without modification) or 'sahaja' (natural state). It's not achieved through effort but recognized as what remains when all mental modifications cease. This motionless, unflickering awareness (aniṅgana) without mental images (anabha sa) is the supreme state (parama pada) - Brahman itself."

    transliteration: "na dveṣṭi kuryātkadācittathā na kurute rāgam | svābhāvikaṁ paraṁ śāntaṁ brahma sampadyate tadā ||",
    translation: "When one neither hates nor desires anything at any time, one realizes the naturally peaceful supreme Brahman.",
    commentary: "The realized person has transcended the pairs of opposites - neither repulsion (dvesha) nor attraction (raga) arises. This is not suppression or indifference but the natural state of one who sees the Self in all. Without the sense of separation, likes and dislikes have no basis. This state is naturally peaceful (svabhavika shanta) - not peace achieved through control, but the inherent peace of Brahman that was always present. When attraction and aversion cease, what remains is supreme peace (parama shanta). This is the hallmark of the realized sage - equanimity (samatvam) in all situations."

    translation: "The knower of Brahman becomes Brahman itself - this is the teaching of the Vedas. One becomes all-knowing, all-pervading, and established in all times.",
    commentary: "This quotes the famous Upanishadic statement: 'Brahmavid brahmaiva bhavati' - the knower of Brahman becomes Brahman. This doesn't mean a transformation from one thing to another, but the recognition of what was always true. The jnani doesn't 'become' omniscient (sarvajña) and omnipresent (sarvaga) - these are realized as one's true nature. The Self is all-knowing because it is the light by which everything is known; all-pervading because it is the very existence of all things; established in all times because it transcends time. This is the promise of the Vedas - know yourself, and you know everything."

    translation: "Thus concludes Atma Bodha, spoken by the revered Shankaracharya. One who studies, reflects, and contemplates this with devotion attains the supreme state.",
    commentary: "This concluding verse summarizes the purpose of the entire text. Atma Bodha (Self-Knowledge) taught by Adi Shankaracharya is complete. The three-fold practice is emphasized: study (paṭhet - reading/hearing), reflection (vicārayet - contemplation), and devotion (puṇyam - with purity of heart). Mere reading doesn't transform; one must reflect deeply on these teachings and contemplate them until they become one's living reality. The promise is certain: sincere practice of these teachings leads to the supreme state (parama pada) - liberation, moksha, the realization of one's true nature as infinite Brahman. This is Shankaracharya's gift to sincere seekers - a complete, practical guide to Self-realization."
