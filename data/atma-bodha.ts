    sanskrit: "तपोभिः क्षीणपापानां शान्तानां वीतरागिणाम्। मुमुक्षूणामपेक्ष्योऽयमात्मबोधो विधीयते॥",
    transliteration: "tapobhiḥ kṣīṇapāpānāṁ śāntānāṁ vītarāgiṇām | mumukṣūṇāmapekṣyo'yamātmabodho vidhīyate ||",
    translation: "This Atma Bodha (Self-Knowledge) is being composed for those whose sins have been destroyed by austerities, who are calm, free from attachment, and are desirous of liberation.",
    commentary: "Shankaracharya opens by defining the qualifications needed to study this profound text. The seeker must have: 1) purified the mind through spiritual practices (tapas), 2) achieved mental peace and tranquility, 3) reduced attachments to worldly objects, and 4) possess a genuine desire for liberation (mumukshutva). These qualifications ensure the teachings will be properly understood and applied."

    sanskrit: "बोधोऽन्यसाधनेभ्यो हि साक्षान्मोक्षैकसाधनम्। पाकस्य वह्निवज्ज्ञानं विना मोक्षो न सिध्यति॥",
    transliteration: "bodho'nyasādhanebhyo hi sākṣānmokṣaikasādhanam | pākasya vahnivajjñānaṁ vinā mokṣo na sidhyati ||",
    translation: "Knowledge alone is the direct means to liberation, unlike other means. As cooking is impossible without fire, so is liberation impossible without Self-knowledge.",
    commentary: "This verse establishes the supremacy of knowledge (jnana) in the path to moksha. While rituals, meditation, and devotion purify the mind and prepare it, only direct knowledge of the Self liberates. The metaphor is powerful: just as no amount of other activities can substitute for fire in cooking, no other practice can replace Self-knowledge for attaining liberation."

    sanskrit: "अविरोधितया कर्म नाज्ञानं विनिवर्तयेत्। विद्याऽविद्यां निहन्त्येव तेजस्तिमिरसङ्घवत्॥",
    transliteration: "avirodhitayā karma nājñānaṁ vinivartayet | vidyā'vidyāṁ nihantyeva tejastimirasaṅghavat ||",
    translation: "Action cannot destroy ignorance, for they are not opposed to each other. Knowledge alone destroys ignorance, as light destroys dense darkness.",
    commentary: "Actions (karma) and ignorance (avidya) operate in different domains. Performing actions - even good actions - cannot remove the fundamental ignorance about our true nature. Only knowledge (vidya) can remove ignorance, just as only light can remove darkness. This doesn't mean actions are useless - they purify the mind and make it fit for receiving knowledge."

    transliteration: "paricchinnamivājñānātsvātmanaḥ parikalpitam | tadvināśe tu tatkincinnnāhamasmīti bhāsate ||",
    translation: "Due to ignorance, the Self, though non-limited, appears limited. When ignorance is destroyed, the Self shines by itself, like the sun after clouds disperse.",
    commentary: "Our true nature is unlimited, infinite consciousness. However, ignorance makes us identify with the limited body-mind complex. When this ignorance is removed through knowledge, the Self is not created or changed - it simply stands revealed, like the sun that was always shining but hidden by clouds."

    sanskrit: "अज्ञानकलुषं जीवं ज्ञानाभ्यासाद्विनिर्मलम्। कृत्वा ज्ञानं स्वयं नश्येत् जलं कतकरेणुवत्॥",
    transliteration: "ajñānakaluṣaṁ jīvaṁ jñānābhyāsādvinirmalam | kṛtvā jñānaṁ svayaṁ naśyet jalaṁ katakarēṇuvat ||",
    translation: "Having purified the individual soul, tainted by ignorance, through constant practice of knowledge, knowledge itself disappears, like the powder of the clearing-nut after purifying water.",
    commentary: "This beautiful analogy explains how knowledge works. The clearing-nut (kataka) powder is used to purify muddy water - it binds with impurities and settles down, leaving clear water. Similarly, the knowledge 'I am not the body-mind, I am pure consciousness' removes ignorance. Once ignorance is gone, even the knowledge used to remove it merges into pure awareness, leaving only the Self."

    transliteration: "saṁsāraḥ svapnatulyaḥ syāt svapnena ca yathā na tathā | nidrāvilayamātreṇa punarāgamanaṁ bhavet ||",
    translation: "The world is like a dream. As in a dream, it appears real during the dream but becomes false on waking, similarly this world appears real in ignorance but unreal in knowledge.",
    commentary: "Shankaracharya uses the dream analogy extensively. While dreaming, the dream world seems completely real - we experience emotions, relationships, and events. But on waking, we realize it was all a mental projection. Similarly, the waking world, experienced through the body-mind, appears real due to ignorance but is recognized as a superimposition on consciousness when we awaken to Self-knowledge."

    transliteration: "janmādimatphalgaṁ satyānṛtamiti dvidhā bhavati | satyānandamanantaṁ brahma​ttaddhi paramārthataḥ ||",
    translation: "Everything that has birth and death, that which has a beginning, middle and end, is divided into real and unreal. Brahman alone is real - it is existence, consciousness, and bliss, infinite and eternal.",
    commentary: "This verse establishes the fundamental Advaita distinction: what is temporary and subject to change is ultimately unreal (mithya), while only the eternal, unchanging Brahman is real (satya). Brahman is described with three attributes: Sat (existence/truth), Chit (consciousness), and Ananda (bliss), and is infinite in nature."

    transliteration: "dvayoḥ saṁśleṣataḥ kāryaṁ vivekaḥ śobhate sadā | svarṇasarpayoriva vivekaḥ paramātmani ||",
    translation: "Discrimination between the Self and the non-Self must always be practiced, just as discrimination between a rope and a snake, or between gold and ornament.",
    commentary: "Viveka (discrimination) is the key practice in Advaita Vedanta. We must learn to distinguish between the eternal Self (Atman) and the temporary non-self (body, mind, world). The classic example: seeing a rope in dim light, we mistake it for a snake - the rope is real, the snake is a misperception. Similarly, we mistake the body-mind for our Self. Constant discrimination reveals the truth."

    translation: "The Self is Truth, eternal Bliss, pure Consciousness. Due to lack of discrimination, all this (the world) appears in it like a dream.",
    commentary: "This verse describes the true nature of the Self (Atman). It is absolute truth (satya), eternal bliss (ananda), self-luminous consciousness (prakasha), and pure (shuddha). The entire phenomenal world appears in this consciousness like a dream appears in the mind of a dreamer. The world seems real only due to lack of discrimination (aviveka)."

    transliteration: "dehe prāṇe manasyātmā hyajānanmanute jaḍaḥ | tanmalādātmavidyāstu tattadbhāvāddhi sarvadā ||",
    translation: "Through ignorance, one thinks 'I am the body', 'I am the vital force', 'I am the mind'. These impurities are removed by Self-knowledge, which reveals the true nature always.",
    commentary: "This verse identifies the fundamental error - misidentification with the body, vital energy (prana), or mind. These are all objects of consciousness, not consciousness itself. The Self is the witness of all these, never the doer or experiencer. Self-knowledge removes this impurity of wrong identification and reveals the ever-present true nature of the Self."

    transliteration: "buddheḥ karmendriyāṇāṁ ca ātmā sākṣī sadā bhavet | rajjau sarpavadāropādbhrāntiḥ syādātmani sthitaḥ ||",
    translation: "The Self is the eternal witness of the intellect and sense organs. The delusion about the Self is like the superimposition of a snake on a rope.",
    commentary: "The Self is the unchanging witness (sakshi) that observes the intellect, senses, and all activities. It is never involved in any action or experience. The mistake of identifying the Self with the body-mind is compared to seeing a rope in dim light and mistaking it for a snake - the rope (Self) is real and never changes, while the snake (body-mind identification) is a false superimposition."

    transliteration: "pañcakośādisaṁyuktam anveṣṭavyam ātmatattvam | upādheḥ vivekena neti netīti vākyataḥ ||",
    translation: "The truth of the Self should be discovered by discriminating it from the five sheaths, through the method of 'not this, not this' (neti neti).",
    commentary: "The Self is covered by five sheaths (koshas): physical, vital, mental, intellectual, and bliss sheath. To realize the Self, we must discriminate and negate each sheath through the method of neti neti (not this, not this). By rejecting everything that is an object of consciousness, what remains is the eternal subject - pure Consciousness itself."

    transliteration: "annamayo'yaṁ puruṣaḥ rasādi pañcabhūtakaḥ | sthūladeha ityabhidhīyate so'yam annakośakaḥ ||",
    translation: "This physical body, made of food essence and the five gross elements, is called the gross body or the food sheath (annamaya kosha).",
    commentary: "The first sheath is the physical body (annamaya kosha), composed of food and the five gross elements (earth, water, fire, air, space). This is the most apparent covering of the Self. It has birth and death, and is subject to decay and disease. The Self, being the witness of this body, is not affected by its changes."

    transliteration: "prāṇādipañcavāyavaḥ vākpāṇipādapāyavaḥ | karmendriyāṇi pañca syuḥ prāṇamayakośakaḥ ||",
    translation: "The five vital airs (pranas) along with the five organs of action constitute the vital sheath (pranamaya kosha).",
    commentary: "The second sheath is the vital sheath, consisting of the five vital forces (prana, apana, vyana, udana, samana) and the five organs of action (speech, hands, feet, organs of excretion and reproduction). This sheath enlivens the physical body but is itself inert when separated from consciousness. The Self is distinct from this sheath as well."

    transliteration: "manaḥ saṁkalpavikalpādibhiḥ jñānendriyaiḥ saha | manomayaḥ parikhyātaḥ kartṛtvādisamanvitaḥ ||",
    translation: "The mind with its functions of doubt and determination, along with the five sense organs, is called the mental sheath (manomaya kosha), associated with the sense of doership.",
    commentary: "The third sheath is the mental sheath, consisting of the mind (manas) and the five sense organs (eyes, ears, nose, tongue, skin). The mind constantly wavers between thoughts, desires, and emotions. It creates the sense of 'I am the doer' (kartritva). However, the Self is the witness of the mind, not the mind itself. The Self remains untouched by mental modifications."

    transliteration: "buddhirjñānendriyaiḥ sārdhaṁ vijñānamayakośakaḥ | vicārakartā jīvasya saṁsārasya karaṇam ||",
    translation: "The intellect along with the sense organs forms the intellectual sheath (vijnanamaya kosha). It is the cause of the individual's bondage to the cycle of birth and death.",
    commentary: "The fourth sheath is the intellectual sheath, composed of the buddhi (intellect) and sense organs. This is the discriminating faculty that determines right from wrong, analyzes, and decides. When this buddhi identifies with the body-mind complex, it creates the sense of individual ego (jiva), which is the root cause of bondage and suffering in samsara."

    transliteration: "anādikālo'vidyāpi upādhiḥ śuddhasattvak aḥ | ānandamayakośaḥ syāt suṣuptau sphurati priyaḥ ||",
    translation: "The beginningless ignorance, made of pure sattva, is the bliss sheath (anandamaya kosha). It manifests clearly in deep sleep as the experience of happiness.",
    commentary: "The fifth and subtlest sheath is the bliss sheath, which is closest to the Self. This is experienced in deep sleep when all other sheaths are temporarily dormant, and we experience peace and bliss. However, this is still a sheath covering the Self, not the Self itself. The Self is the witness even of this bliss, and transcends all five koshas."

    transliteration: "pañcakośavilakṣaṇaḥ sansaccidānandarūpakaḥ | sarvadā sarvagaḥ śuddhaḥ sa ātmā tvamasītyalam ||",
    translation: "Distinct from the five sheaths, of the nature of Existence-Consciousness-Bliss, always all-pervading and pure - That Self is You. This is enough.",
    commentary: "After negating all five sheaths through discrimination, what remains is the true Self - pure Existence (Sat), Consciousness (Chit), and Bliss (Ananda). This Self is not limited by space or time, is eternally pure, and pervades everything. The great Vedantic declaration 'Tat Tvam Asi' (That Thou Art) points to this identity between the individual Self and the Supreme Self."

    sanskrit: "स्थूलाभासे पटादौ यथा तन्तुस्तथात्मनि। विकारोपाधयः सर्वे तेषां सत्यमिदं जगत्॥",
    transliteration: "sthūlābhāse paṭādau yathā tantustathātmani | vikāropādhayaḥ sarve teṣāṁ satyamidaṁ jagat ||",
    translation: "Just as thread is the reality in a cloth and various forms, so the Self is the reality in all modifications and limiting adjuncts. For them (the modifications), this world is real.",
    commentary: "This verse uses the analogy of thread and cloth. Just as all cloth products are essentially thread in different forms, all objects in the universe are essentially the Self appearing in various forms. The modifications (vikara) and limiting adjuncts (upadhi) are superimposed on the Self. From the relative standpoint, the world is real, but from the absolute standpoint, only the Self is real."

    sanskrit: "शरीरं साधनं ज्ञानस्य ज्ञानं मुक्तेः साधनम्। शरीरस्य विनाशोऽपि न मुक्तौ बाधको भवेत्॥",
    transliteration: "śarīraṁ sādhanaṁ jñānasya jñānaṁ mukteḥ sādhanam | śarīrasya vināśo'pi na muktau bādhako bhavet ||",
    translation: "The body is the instrument for acquiring knowledge, and knowledge is the means to liberation. The destruction of the body is not an obstacle to liberation.",
    commentary: "This verse clarifies that while the human body is necessary as an instrument to acquire Self-knowledge through study and practice, knowledge itself is what brings liberation, not bodily death. Liberation is the realization of our eternal nature, which transcends the body. When one gains Self-knowledge while alive, the eventual death of the body doesn't affect the already-realized state of freedom."

  {
    number: 21,
    sanskrit: "नाहं देहो न मे देहो बोधोऽहं बोधरूपधृक्। इत्थं विवेकतः पश्यन् ब्रह्मज्ञः स्वप्रकाशवान्॥",
    transliteration: "nāhaṁ deho na me deho bodho'haṁ bodharūpadhṛk | itthaṁ vivekataḥ paśyan brahmajñaḥ svaprakāśavān ||",
    translation: "I am not the body, nor is the body mine. I am knowledge itself, the very form of consciousness. Seeing thus through discrimination, the knower of Brahman becomes self-luminous.",
    commentary: "This is a key discriminative statement. Through viveka, one realizes: I am not the body, the body is not my possession - I am pure consciousness itself. When this realization stabilizes through constant contemplation, one becomes a knower of Brahman (brahmajnah). Such a person is self-luminous (svaprakasha), needing no external source for knowledge or happiness."

    number: 22,
    sanskrit: "आत्मनः शुद्धबोधस्य देहेन्द्रियगुणक्रियाः। आरोपिताः पटतन्तुन्यायेन रज्जुसर्पवत्॥",
    transliteration: "ātmanaḥ śuddhabodhasya dehendriyaguṇakriyāḥ | āropitāḥ paṭatantunyāyena rajjusarpavat ||",
    translation: "The qualities and activities of the body and senses are superimposed on the Self, which is pure consciousness, like the rope appearing as a snake or thread appearing as cloth.",
    commentary: "The Self is pure, actionless consciousness. All the qualities (gunas) and activities (kriyas) belong to the body-mind complex, not to the Self. Yet through ignorance, we superimpose these on the Self, thinking 'I am fat', 'I am happy', 'I am doing this'. This is a false superimposition (adhyasa), like seeing a snake where there is only a rope, or seeing cloth and forgetting the underlying thread."

  {
    number: 23,
    sanskrit: "आत्मनो विक्रियां नित्यं पश्यत्यज्ञोऽप्यहं ध्रुवः। रज्जुं सर्पं च पश्यन्नपि रज्जुरेव सत्यम्॥",
    transliteration: "ātmano vikriyāṁ nityaṁ paśyatyajño'pyahaṁ dhruvaḥ | rajjuṁ sarpaṁ ca paśyannapi rajjureva satyam ||",
    translation: "The ignorant person constantly sees change in the changeless Self, thinking 'I am the doer'. Just as one seeing a snake in a rope doesn't change the rope - the rope alone is real.",
    commentary: "The ignorant person constantly attributes change, action, and modification to the Self, thinking 'I am aging', 'I am becoming happy or sad', 'I am the doer of actions'. But just as mistaking a rope for a snake doesn't change the rope in any way, our misperception doesn't change the Self. The Self remains eternally changeless (dhruva) and untouched by any modifications."

    transliteration: "tamomayadtvānnīhārarāśikalpito yathā sūryaḥ | tadvadātmāpi bhrāntyā śarīreṇa kalpito'jñānāt ||",
    translation: "Just as the sun appears to be covered by clouds and fog due to darkness, similarly the Self appears to be limited by the body due to ignorance.",
    commentary: "The sun is self-luminous and is never actually covered by clouds - the clouds only appear to obstruct our vision of the sun. Similarly, the Self is self-effulgent consciousness that cannot actually be covered or limited by anything. It only appears to be limited by the body due to ignorance (ajnana). When ignorance is removed, the Self is seen to be eternally free and unlimited."

    transliteration: "dehatritayavilakṣaṇaḥ sākṣī caitanyamātrakaḥ | trisvapi dehatrayeṣvahaṁ na ca matsthāni tānyapi ||",
    translation: "The Self is distinct from the three bodies, the eternal witness, pure consciousness. Though I exist in all three bodies, these bodies don't exist in Me.",
    commentary: "The Self is different from the three bodies - gross (physical), subtle (mind-intellect), and causal (ignorance). It is the witness (sakshi) of all three, being pure consciousness itself. Though the Self illumines and pervades all three bodies (like space pervading pots), the bodies don't affect or limit the Self, just as pots don't limit space. This is the asymmetrical relationship between consciousness and its objects."

    transliteration: "asti bhāti priyaṁ rūpaṁ nāma cetyaṁśapañcakam | ādyatrayaṁ brahmarūpaṁ jagadrūpaṁ tato dvayam ||",
    translation: "Existence, consciousness, bliss, name, and form - these are the five constituents. The first three belong to Brahman; name and form constitute the world.",
    commentary: "Every object in the universe can be analyzed into five aspects: Existence (asti), Consciousness/appearance (bhati), Bliss/desirability (priya), Name (nama), and Form (rupa). The first three - existence, consciousness, and bliss - belong to Brahman, the ultimate reality. Name and form are the superimposition that creates the apparent world. When we separate the name-form from an object, what remains is Brahman alone."

    translation: "Name and form are perishable, but the Self is of the nature of eternal truth. Just as the name and form 'pot' are temporary, but clay (its substance) is real and enduring.",
    commentary: "This verse uses the classic clay-pot analogy. A pot is named and shaped from clay, but the name 'pot' and the form of the pot are temporary and will perish. However, clay - the substance - is real and persists. Similarly, all names and forms in the universe are temporary modifications of Brahman, while Brahman itself is the eternal, unchanging reality that underlies all appearances."

    transliteration: "sarvaṁ sattvamayaṁ bhāti sākṣī bhātīti kalpanā | sattvena bhāti sattvasya bhāsakatvaṁ na yujyate ||",
    translation: "Everything appears through the quality of sattva (purity). The witness doesn't appear - this is only a notion. Sattva appears through consciousness; to say consciousness appears through sattva is illogical.",
    commentary: "Objects appear in consciousness when the mind is purified (sattvic). However, consciousness (the witness) doesn't 'appear' - it is self-luminous and eternal. It's illogical to say consciousness appears through sattva, because sattva itself is illumined by consciousness. The witness-consciousness is the ultimate subject that can never become an object. All objects appear in it, but it doesn't appear in anything."

    translation: "By this knowledge, the destruction of ignorance is achieved. 'I am Brahman, I am of the nature of Existence-Consciousness, I am ever auspicious' - this is the realization.",
    commentary: "When discrimination removes all false identifications, what remains is the direct realization: 'I am Brahman' (Aham Brahmasmi). This is one of the four great Vedantic statements (Mahavakyas). The realized person knows directly: I am pure Existence-Consciousness (Sat-Chit), I am ever auspicious and free (Shiva). This is not intellectual knowledge but direct, experiential realization that destroys ignorance forever."

    translation: "There is no dissolution, no creation, no one bound, no seeker, no one desirous of liberation, nor anyone liberated. This is the ultimate truth.",
    commentary: "This profound verse presents the absolute truth from the highest perspective. From the viewpoint of the Self, there is no creation or dissolution of the universe, no bondage or spiritual practice, no seeker or liberation - because the Self is eternally free and complete. All these concepts exist only in the realm of relative reality. This is known as the ajata vada (doctrine of non-origination) - the highest teaching that nothing has ever been created, and the Self alone exists."
